I apologize for not pursuing this, my father died shortly afterward.  I did research and WEWP can make this EAWP-type call, though it may sound slightly different.  Without more documentation there is nothing more I can do.  I wish to stress that I have just spent the summer in WEWP breeding habitats and found multiple WEWP nests yet I have never suspected throughout that I may be hearing an Eastern Wood-Pewee save this one instance.----I doubt this will be accepted by the Nevada Bird Records Committee, and if not I will remove it from my checklist.----I found a possible Eastern Wood-Pewee at Corn Spring today.  I have done work for over a decade on Western Wood-Pewees in CA, NV, and AZ, mist-netting, point counting, and nest monitoring.  I've spent the last four years living part-time in Michigan, and I when I moved there I found the chip note of the Eastern Wood-Pewee particularly notable, for I had never heard WEWP to do it, and I spent many minutes chasing eastern 'warblers' only to find they were chipping EAWP when I was in Michigan.  The note is a soft chip, not exactly a Myrtle Warbler chip but approaching that.----In the northeast corner of the Corn Spring orchard I found two pewees present/semi-territorial throughout the morning today.  One gave chip notes over and over (this is what attracted me to them, as there are many WEWP around), and the second bird, clearly a WEWP, was generally bullying the bird that was giving the chips.----I recorded the chips and watched the birds for probably 70-90 minutes, returning repeatedly after forays to look at other birds.  It was always only a matter of a few minutes before I would hear the suspect pewee give EAWP chip notes.  I felt that I could have remained there all day listening to the chip notes at my leisure.  The dominant, clear WEWP sallies from a spigot close to the wooden fence and two trees @ 5-10 m south of the fence, toward the housing.  The possible EAWP stayed to the trees and often sallied from the north edge of their canopies, also close to the fence.----Western Wood-Pewees can indeed give this call, it is rare.  Here is an example:--http://www.xeno-canto.org/explore?query&#61;nr%3A124999----None of my friends and colleagues so far knew WEWP to do it, underscoring the rareness of it.  But since they can do it, it underscores the probability the record will be rejected.  The fact that this bird only gave chips, and it gave them over and over for a very long duration is notable, as is the fact that it was getting bullied repeatedly by a clear WEWP (Empids and flycatchers are often skirmishing but the abuse this bird was receiving rose above other interactions I saw today).----I will attach recordings I made with my phone.  I photographed the bird but I was not hard-core listing; the WEWP that tormented this bird showed very well and I took many photographs of it as well, I am not always certain which bird was which in my photographs.  If the reviewer wishes to view my entire string of photos in the roll, just let me know.
