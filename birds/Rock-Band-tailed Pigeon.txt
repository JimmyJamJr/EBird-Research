They looked more like Band-tailed, because all 4 birds looked similar, I did not see a white rump on any of them (could have been missed though), and on one bird the outer half of the wing was obviously darker than the inner half (did not see if that was true of the other 3 birds). Just not quite a good enough look for a positive ID.
