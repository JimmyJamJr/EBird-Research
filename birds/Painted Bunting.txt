The bunting was just behind the newly created marsh below the last pond.  There are tall grasses growing between the pasture and the corner of the "Bone Yard" (equipment storage area).  The Painted was loosely associated with about three or four Lazuli's.  She was viewed from the rim of the last pond looking down.  I worked over to where she was feeding, not caring about getting my shoes and socks wet. Once I was over by the grasses, I ended up with very good photos of her.  I left her feeding at the same location and retreated back through the water.

Most views of birds were obscured as they were seeking cover or only quick flyovers.  I was actually getting rather frustrated because around every turn there was a Sharp-shinned or a CooperÂ¿s Hawk.  Eventually at around 8 AM the bird activity picked up with at least some of the Accipiters being fed or at least calming down.  I was near the northeast corner of the equipment yard when I heard an interesting call note being repeated frequently.  I made my way over to where the call was coming from (near the end of the trail that passes through the two former lower ponds) and quickly found a PAINTED BUNTING.  The bird was brighter green with a more yellowish-greenish front than all of the other fall birds I have seen in Nevada which leads me to believe it may have been a first year male.  I managed to get a few pictures of the bird as it worked its way over to the sunflower row on the southern edge of the equipment yard. Additional notes:  strong chip-type note (Yellow-rumped Warblerish but more of a Bunting quality), bright green back and wings, no wingbars, evenly colored yellow greenish front, bunting shaped bill with curved culmen (gray with yellowish color near base of gape), thin yellowish eyering, seen at 8:15 AM.

I found this bird around the upper spring.  It was loosely associating with two Lazuli Buntings.  It called some as it move around.  After about 20 minutes of observing it moving around in the scrub, it sat up in the sun only about five feet away and I got crippling photos.  I also observed it go to the spring and have a drink.

Very dull bird (or my lighting was bad).  Bird seen only in the shade.  Initially by itself but later joined by Lazulis.  With bins, the bird had a faint but noticeable greenish olive tones to the upperparts.  Thought the culmen looked quite curved and so waited for better lighting to make sure it wasn't a Varied but the bird disappeared.  However even with the bad lighting, the faint green tones was seen with bins which rule out Varied.  Probably young female

This is just inside the fence from the parking area.  Martin saw the bird briefly and was trying to reposition himself when the bird flew across in front of me.  Martin was unable to see the bird in flight due to tall vegetation in his line of sight.  The bird was seen very briefly, but the plumage was diagnostic.  The bunting was very green, plain faced, with a thick bunting bill, and no wingbars or pattern in the tail.  The overall green color was shockingly bright.  I was able to get a good but short look as the bird made its few second flight across the pond.  Much to MartinÃ¢s dismay, we were unable to relocate the bird.  This bird would have been a new Nevada bird for Martin.--

I found the bird at about 10:30 am.  Field notes:  very worn female, greenish tones still visible on crown, back and wings, buffy-grayish front, very plain drab grayish back (plumage), slightly curved (drooping) bill, bill long for bunting and longer than nearby Lazuli Buntings, yellow gape, pale eyering, no real wingbars, called frequently and unlike that of Lazuli.

It took me about 15 minutes before I was able to get nice photos of the bird as moved around the orchard and eventually settled down to pick at an apple.  The bright green and pale gray plumage, bright bluish-green shoulder, small buffy eye ring, buffy breast and belly, small conical bill with a curved culmen and pale yellowish gape clearly identified this bird as a Painted Bunting.

The bunting was mostly all bright green with a yellowish breast and belly, no wing bars, thick gray bunting bill with curved culmen, and pale yellowish thin eyering.  I managed to get some good pictures.  The bird then moved to the neighboring lawn and then out behind that home. It called a few times while it was perched on a fence.  Bird was observed from 10:35 AM to 10:40 AM.----Photo 1 at: --https://www.flickr.com/photos/nvbirdr/17639886170/in/dateposted-public/----Photo 2 at:  --https://www.flickr.com/photos/nvbirdr/17204684214/in/dateposted-public/

She called Vermilion Flycatcher because the bird was facing her and she could only see the bright red front.  Dennis quickly followed with the call Painted Bunting.  I quickly worked my way to them and when I got on the bird I was surprised to see it was an adult male.  The bird flew to another Rubber Rabbitbrush and perched for a few seconds before flying further out into the desert.  The bird then turned and flew back to the rest stop and I managed to get some very poor but easily identifiable pictures.  The blue head, red underparts, green back and wings and red around the eye were all easily observed and unmistakable. We were unable to relocate the bird even though we thought we saw roughly where it went.  It must have continued past the rest stop heading south.

The bird was in a tall grassy depression near an oxbow of the Truckee River (coordinates:  39'32'45" N, 119'34'14" W taken off my cell phone).  The bird was feeding on the numerous grass seeds with five Lazuli Buntings.  The bird had a bright green upper back and rump, green top to the head (crown), a grayish-greenish face with a white to buffy complete eye ring, no obvious wing bars on gray wings, gray legs, buffy flanks and undertail coverts, a bunting shaped gray bill with a moderately curved culmen and yellow gape line and was roughly the same size and build as nearby Lazuli Buntings.  Other than the green upper back and top of the head, the bird was fairly nondescript.  I got a number of photos of the bird.  At 9:40 AM on my return hike, I relocated the bird in the same area.  I walked around the grass patch and the bird popped up and perched on a young Cottonwood branch on the far side of the grassy depression.  I got better photos this time as the bird preened for a minute or two.  It then dropped back down into the tall green grasses.  After the better looks and photos I obtained during the second sighting, I believe the bird is either an adult female (which I don't think would be very likely this far outside its normal migration route) or it could be a first fall male (as HY birds are more likely to get lost and wonder).  Documentation will be submitted to the NBRC.

Probably a HY bird.  Green head and back, grayish below, bunting-type bill.  Same size as the nearby Lazulis.  No wing bars.  Life bird!
