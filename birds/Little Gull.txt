While I was scanning the gulls, I noticed that there were some Bonaparte's Gulls in the mostly Ring-bill flock.  For an unknown reason, the Bonaparte's took flight and the numbers kept increasing as more birds that were hidden from my view took off.  I was counting the individuals in flight when I saw an obviously smaller gull in the group.  I immediately noticed the smaller shorter bill and dark primary tips to the all white underwing.  I then got a view of the back pattern and new right away it was a Little Gull.  The black M pattern was quite bold and the secondaries were all mostly white which provided a white trailing edge to the wing (which was in direct comparison to a first winter Bonaparte's that it was flying with that had a black trailing edge to the upperwing).  The small dark collar mark and face pattern were also seen well in flight.  The bird was clearly a first winter bird.  The gulls circled overhead a few times and the Bonaparte's went towards Hemenway while the Little Gull broke off and headed out over the water to the North.

I managed to take some identifiable flight shots of the bird to help document this state first.  Four or five other birders from the Las Vegas area also made the trip up to enjoy the bird at different times of the day.  Before I left, the gull swallowed a very large (compared to it's own diminutive size) dead fish.  I was worried the bird would choke to death before other observers could view it tomorrow.  But after about fifteen minutes the ambitious gull finally fit the entire fish down its throat.

I was up at Warrior Point when Martin called me to inform me that he just found a Little Gull.  I made a quick dash down to the south end of the lake and began walking north to the delta.  I walked out about half way to the Truckee River delta when I saw a Coyote make a run at the gull flock.  Martin called and said he lost the bird when the Coyote flushed the birds.  I began watching the water near me and the Little Gull and two Bonaparte's Gulls flew right past.  They settled near the shorebirds at the south end, but they didn't stay long.  They began flying back north towards me.  I went out as close to the shore as I could get to hopefully get them to pass behind me (to the east) for optimal photo light.  I got some really nice flight shots as the bird flew by at about 10-15 feet off the ground.  The gull was clearly a first winter bird with an extensive dark black upperwing pattern ("M"), fairly broad black tipped tail, black hind cap, small black ear spot, black collar and a small thin black bill.  Photos obtained.  Nevada's second record.
