About an hour later after Greg had to go to work Linda, John and I went back to same tree line (cottonwoods w/ Russian Olives near the start of the desert area by far bathrooms) and were able to relocate.  Bird had prominent complete white eye-ring, brownish hood & upper breast, yellow belly & undertail coverts, long undertail coverts extending well out towards tail tip, olive brown upperparts, and bulky, more thrush-like shape/structure.  I'm very familiar with this species and usually see a couple most falls in NJ; I've also seen them on the breeding grounds in Minnesota.

It was also seen around and drinking from the little stream that connects the two ponds near picnic bench #40.  Field notes:  brownish hood (extending down onto the lower breast), complete white eyering, large bill (pale lower mandible, more prominate at the base), long pink legs, long yellow undertail cotail coverts, yellow belly, olive back and wings, streatched out warbler, tail appeared short, bird would walk around and jump up to remove insects from low lying leaves and branches overhead, panted contnuously in the heat (105 degrees F), seen and photographed for 15 minutes, refound at 5:10 pm and photographed and observed for 5 more minutes, not really shy but very secretive, amazing how it could remain unseen in such a small area, seen in flight a few times.
