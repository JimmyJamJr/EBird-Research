Dark brown overall, dark brown belly and undertail, no border between the chest and the belly, dark brown tail feathers too, no curlew feather on the tail. Well defined border between the chest and the neck. Head with fine strikes, Bill all olive green-yellow, no spots. No open wings shot, but on several pictures is visible that blue panel is bordered with narrow white stripes. I look for a third opinion and David Sibley was so kind to respond, please see the quot bellow----Hi Daniel,----I agree with you, that's definitely not a Mallard. The overall darkness, dark flank and scapular feathers with pale fringes but no obvious pale internal markings, very dark undertail coverts, all fit Mexican Duck and not Mallard. Photos of the upper side of the spread wing would be helpful to confirm.----I'm guessing it's a male given the yellow-green bill without any darker markings on the culmen, but more photos to confirm the bill color would help determine the sex. Also if you can see it alongside any other Mallard-type ducks the overall size and proportions will help distinguish male from female. That's important because if it is a male the plumage is more distinctive, and the absence of any hybrid features (like curled uppertail coverts) is significant. If it's a female then it can still be identified by the darkness of the plumage, but it's more subtle and ruling out a hybrid is much more difficult.----This is all ignoring the possibility of Mottled Duck or American Black Duck, which can probably be safely ruled out on range alone, but extremely difficult on appearance.----I'm happy to answer more questions or look at more photos if you like----Best,--David--sibleyguides@gmail.com--www.sibleyguides.com

I fully admit, I did not realize what I had until home processing photos (to be added shortly), and saw that brown tail without any white.  Dark plumage overall.  Speculum purple in color, but that could be due to light.  Thinner lower white band on speculum.  Bill color in range for the species.  Asked and received a positive opinion from a local waterfowl expert and friend.--I am returning to the park to see if I can find the bird again, and get additional photos of the rest of the duck.

Merlin app IDs this bird as a Mexican duck. Requesting confirmation, I received this reply from Tony Leukering: "The male is a Mexican Duck. The white on the tail is restricted to the outer webs of the outer rectrices, which typically bleach by this time in many individuals of the various "dark Mallards." This is particularly true of one-year-olds, whose tail feathers are juvenile plumage and have been wearing and bleaching for nearly a year, a feature that enables ducks of most species to be aged as one-year-olds. There is no suggestion of curl in the tail. There are no solidly black under- or upper-tail coverts. This bird is a Mexican Duck."
