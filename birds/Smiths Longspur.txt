Nearly all of us(minus 2) were treated to excellent looks at the female Smith's Longspur as it fed in the road and along the roadside for a good 2-3 minutes.  We did also have the bird calling in flight at least 3 times.  We saw the bird at around 1130 am.  In the afternoon, the birds settled down and were very quiet.  Being that you really have to hear the Smith's to hope to see it, and it seems to only calls in flight, the best time to look for this bird is when the birds are very active.

I signed in at 9:30 and drove straight to the longspur spot on the west side.----At the lookout towers, I found some other interesting birds but couldn't find the Short-eared Owl or Ibis.  Some of the species numbers given below are rough estimates, since I wasn't keeping track very carefully.	***VERY RARE; found earlier in December by Jack Walters. I was extremely lucky to see it perch up on a mound for photos (albeit blurry ones).----After sorting through the flocks for an hour and a half, I saw and heard several LAPLAND LONGSPURS, heard a few CHESTNUT-COLLARED LONGSPURS, and had an extremely brief view--of a good candidate Smith's Longspur.  During a lull in the action, I walked back to the car parked at the corner to get some water.  And as soon as I opened the car door I heard a four-syllable rattle overhead - the SMITH'S LONGSPUR had come to see me!  It landed not far from the car, on top of some gravel mounds where all the SAVANNAH SPARROWS hang out.  I dashed back to my spotting scope and managed to snap a few photos and some video before it flew off to the north. Although the bird wasn't facing me, the photos do show the wing formula and the narrow rufous edges to the tertials.  In the quicktime video, the bird turns its head around so you can see the buffy nape, broken auriculars, white eye ring, and the bill.

First state record found by myself and Paul Lehman. Accepted by the NBRC #2010-019.
