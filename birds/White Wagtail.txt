Small and attenuated, long-tailed passerine walking frantically and pumping tail while bobbing head. White belly, dark throat, gray back with white wing patch. Tail mostly dark with white outer recs. Called a high, scratchy “chee-dzee” while in bounding flight, where it’s showed extensive white to primaries and secondaries, separating it from ocularis.----When approaching from 169, take Bowman Rd to open clay pull off and boat ramp overlooking the reservoir. I initially saw the bird feeding on the small island while I stood near the boat ramp. It later crossed from the small island towards me, and it later worked the western shoreline, allowing for close views from the pull off. It seemed to favor this area, never straying too far, and it made it's way towards the island again as I left.
