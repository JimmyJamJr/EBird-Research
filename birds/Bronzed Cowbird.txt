We could have easily photographed this bird at any time during several observations (we saw this bird and flock of Starlings multiple times during our morning at Corn Creek).  However since this was the first time that Cindy Chang had seen Bronzed Cowbird (a “life” bird for her), we spent extra time looking at the bird and noting the field marks.----The bird was all dark. It was similar in size to the European Starlings (but appearing bulkier), and slightly bigger than the Brown-headed Cowbirds.  The head was dark (blackish) with an obvious bold, red eye.  The red eye was seen well on several occasions.  The bill was larger (longer) in comparison to the bills on the Brown-headed Cowbirds.  It was bulkier than the bills of blackbird species (more conical shaped than the starlings and longer than the Brown-headed Cowbirds).  The nape was thick, contributing to its bulky appearance.----The wings were glossy purple/blue (like a grackle). The tail was glossy black.   ----The legs were dark.

I immediately recognized the bird as a Bronzed Cowbird by its overall shape before I even lifted my binoculars.  The bird dropped down to the stream for a drink before flying back up in the dead branches and then flying out behind the houses.  It landed with the Rock Pigeons and began searching for food in the bare areas.  The bird moved around the area and returned to the water a second time to drink.  I managed to get some good photos of the bird.  Six people observed the bird including Jim and Marian Cressman, Theresa Hyde, Rod Bailey, and another lady whose name I didn't catch.
