Initially thought of the expected Warbling Vireo, but face pattern was much too strong. First noticed a distinct eyeline, with a sharply contrasting white supercilium and dark gray cap. Wings and back were bright green without any wingbars. Yellow undertail coverts, flanks, and sides of the throat with white belly and central throat. Yellow was surprisingly bright. Bill was at least partially a pale nude color (lower mandible) and obviously long for a vireo.  Never vocalized. Pictures forthcoming but revealed extensive yellow underneath, pale bill, and a weaker than originally-thought supercilium.

He finally was able to see and identify it today.  I drove down and observed the bird multiple times as I tried to photograph it.  The bird responded to YGVI tapes and would fly in and try to out sing the tape.  Interestingly enough, it would not respond to Red-eyed Vireo songs.  The bird was seen well and all features were noted.  I have extensive notes on the sighting and they were submitted to the NBRC.  This bird was accepted by the NBRC.
