I spent a 1.5 hours studying the bird through a scope.  I managed some distant but hopefully diagnostic photos.  The bird was near the "shorebird" point and spent most of the time sitting on the water drifting in the wind.  The bird flew a few times to get away from the shore when it drifted too close.  When resting on the water the bird provided excellent scope views.  Being that Parasitic Jaeger is a NBRC review species I took fairly detailed notes for submission.  A few of the most obvious features of this bird were a long thin bicolored bill with the end 1/3 being black and the base being blue-gray, central tail feathers were clearly sharply pointed and projected just beyond tail, large white flash in wings (primary basses), buffy cinnamon wash, buffy edged primaries on folded wing, dark back and wings with broad buffy tips forming a barred look, barred rear flanks and undertail coverts (dark and buffy to cinnamon pattern), long wings, strong deep flight pattern, white rump in flight with irregular broken dark barring, streaked neck and nape, dark eye, and a small head with a slight peak to crown.  ----Subsequently accepted by NBRC.

The sun was at my back when observing the bird which gave me great looks through my binoculars and then my scope at the lit-up bird. Just as the bird reached the west side of North Nutgrass Lake, it saw then chased a Gull and when it wheeled up after it, I could clearly but briefly see the thinly barred undertail with the short central tail feathers and the white under the primary feathers. It appeared to land along the west shore of North Nutgrass Lake so I visually scoped out a planned route to get to that area by hiking interconnected dikes. and after getting about halfway there I saw the Jaeger flying back just next to where I was parked at where it harassed 2 or 3 Ring-Billed Gulls. I momentarily lost sight of it but hurried back to my parked vehicle. After looking around for another hour and slowly driving along Pintail Road, I was not able to relocate the Jaeger.

I quickly raised my camera and got a number of fair photos of the bird as it flew by.  The bird was mostly dark with deep slow wing beats.  With my binoculars I was able to observe a long (when talking about Jaegers) relatively thin bill, silvery white based primaries on the underwing, deep chested appearance, small head, and very short central tail feather projection.  When I got the pictures on my computer I was able to see more detail.  The central tail feathers appear to barely project beyond the tail and they are indeed pointed (good for Parasitic most of the time), the underwing coverts coloration matches the flanks (good for Parasitic and not Long-tailed), the fairly uniform coloration on the breast and belly (not white bellied like light morph Long-tailed), the undertail coverts are very weakly barred (better for Parasitic), there appears to be 3 very white primary shafts with the fourth one being lightly colored in the photo verging towards white at the base (better for Parasitic), the bill appears long and thin with about the end 1/3 being dark (Parasitic feature), small headed (Parasitic feature), fairly deep chested in profile (Parasitic feature) and lacked strongly black and white barring on rump (a Long-tailed feature).  In fact in one of the photos, I used Photoshop to lighten the shadows and darken the highlights and I was able to see faint thin wavy bars on the undertail coverts, which is a very good feature for Parasitic.  Also important was the birds large size and unrushed deep flight.  There was nothing buoyant or tern-like in this birds flight.  As for Pomarine Jaeger, that was safely eliminated by this birds 3-4 white primary shafts (should be many and bright in Pomarine in all ages and plumages), small head, long thin bill, short pointed central tail feathers, lack of bright pale underwing coverts, lack of strongly barred undertail and uppertail coverts, and overall size (yes I said the bird was big, but I didnt get the impression it was really large and bulky).  As with all juvenile Jaegers, the identification is very tricky and a combination of features and an overall impression of the bird are all important in identifying them to species.  I feel relatively comfortable in calling this bird a PARASITIC JAEGER based on the features noted, the photos and the overall impression the birds flight pattern and size.  It was odd watching this bird pass over houses as it flew west towards down town Las Vegas.  What a strange location and way to see a Jaeger.--

The bird had large flashes of white in the wing from above and below and appeared larger than the Long-tails we had just finished watching back at Sutcliff.  Also, the wing beats were deeper and more erratic.  Soon, the Jaeger we were watching began pursuing another dark juvenile Jaeger.  This new Jaeger was obviously smaller.  The larger Jaeger's wings were longer and the body was larger (heavier).  We watched the two Jaegers for 20-30 minutes.  We eventually got good looks at the Parasitic when it landed in the water.  The two very short pointed central tail feathers were noted at this point.  Both birds were never far apart.  They were almost always chasing something or each other.

At the mouth we were stationary for 45 minutes.	What appeared to be a juvenile, dark morph Jaeger was first pointed out by Dennis Serdehely as it flew past four of us, in a southwesterly direction towards popcorn rock, as we were standing at the mouth of the river observing several groups of Terns. We noted an overall very dark bodied, gull like bird with indications of white under the wings and tail. We also noted a stubby feather(s) protruding from the center of the tail. In silhouette the wings appeared more narrow near the body and the bill appeared long and slim. We observed this bird for approx 15 min. during which time it made several radical diving turns and chased and harassed a number of other birds over the bay. We were able to get a few photos that shows the bird in silhouette, however, because of the smokey conditions in the area they do not show much in the way of color or detail. The photos have been sent to NRBC for review.

The sun was directly at our backs which really lit up the Jaeger as it flew by.  The body had an overall rusty/cinnamon color to it, the white shafts on the outer primary feathers were obvious, the slender bill was apparent, and it occasionally would swoop down and harass/chase the gulls resting along the shoreline.  We did not have the time or opportunity to try to get a photo.  We tried to relocate it down at Nine Mile Beach, up at Monument Rock, and back again in Thunderbolt Bay, but it was not observed again.

The bird was first noticed far from shore, where it briefly landed, then came straight in towards a group of California Gulls along shore, north of the marina near a small point. There, it immediately began chasing the gulls. It looked smaller than the CAGUs, perhaps about the size of a Ring-billed Gull, but the wings weren't as long nor the flight as tern-like as Long-tailed. The bird was aggressive in it's pursuit of the gulls, and put on a great show! Too bad I was a couple hundred yards away! Initially, from a distance, the bird appeared dark w/ very obvious prominent silvery white patches at the base of the primaries. Importantly, this patch was visible ON THE UPPER WING as well as the underwing (appearing about 90% as large above as below; a very helpful field mark on the young Parasitics who show this character). While near shore, I had better looks at the bird as it wheeled around chasing gulls. Those views revealed a light rusty rump (showing some barring), lighter underparts washed rusty, cylindrical body (not barrel-chested like Pomarine or tapering towards the rear as in Long-tailed), and a broader hand (i.e., the wings were not as long and pointy looking) compared to Long-tailed.     The structural details, aggressive behavior while chasing gulls, prominent white patch at the base of the primaries on the upperwing, and extensive warm/rusty tones, all looked great for a darker light morph imm. Parasitic Jaeger.    Photos below are posted at at www.flickr.com/photos/pauljhurtado/

A late October early November Jaeger in the interior West should be looked at very closely, as Pomarine is possibly more likely at this time of year.  So my interest was immediately peaked.  I saw some of the distant digiscoped pics obtained by Dennis Ghiglieri from Saturday and thought the bird could be a Pomarine.  So Monday morning early I went out to Pyramid and spent an hour and 15 minutes looking for the bird near Popcorn Rock.  I could not locate any Jaeger.  I spoke to Martin Meyers after my failed attempt and he decided to check for it again.  When he arrived at around 12 pm he saw the bird fly in.  He called me and said I better head out there.  I arrived at around 1:20 pm to find out the bird flew minutes before.  We scanned the area for about 20 minutes before Martin spotted the bird back on one of the mudflats/sandbars.  Somehow it reappeared without us seeing it fly in.  We took distant photos and then put the scope on it. The bird was feeding on something when we first saw it but then it quickly settled and laid down on the ground. The bill looked intermediate and possibly within the range of both Pomarine and Parasitic.  The bird appeared bulky with a heavy deep chesty profile.  Clearly a worn light morph juvenile bird with a nearly white head.  Upper back was very dark and the wings were dark brown.  We watched the bird for about 15 minutes from a nearby sandbar.  I decided to jump over and through some water channels to get closer to the bird for better photos and to try to get photos of the tail pattern.  The bird was completely unconcerned with me and allowed me to get within 15 feet.  The bird then flew up and across the water towards the delta.  There were 6-8 white primary shafts visible on the upperwing.  My photos show that the central tail feathers are broad and possibly rounded with small points, but subsequent photos by others reveal the true tail pattern as being consistent with Parasitic.  Not sure why I couldn't see this feature in the field or why my photos don't show it, but it is very evident in other's pictures.   We observed the bird until 2:02 pm for a total of 23 minutes of observation time.  I feel the overall size and structure are good for Pomarine, especially when viewed in person.  The concern here is when I began to go through and process my photos, I began to see rufous tones in the bird especially in the upper tail coverts region.  Also, there appears to be remnants of pale tips to the primaries which would be good for Parasitic.  I sent the photos out for other opinions and I received a mix bag of answers back, but most felt it had characteristics of Parasitic.  Since new good photos have been obtained, there is little doubt now that the bird is a Parasitic.  The remaining rufous tones, pointed central rectrices, white edges to primary tips and rusty wavy barring un uppertail coverts are all consistent with Parasitic.  Luckily good photos have been obtained to clear up this difficult identification.

The tail shape and start of a point not good for Pomarine.  The long slender bill shape and head not round not good for Pomarine.  Overall color and the rufous/cinnamon tone and irregular weak undertail covert barring are wrong for Long-tailed.  Also good for Parasitic are the well-defined pale tips on the primaries with the start of the white band behind the leading edge of the wing, the streaky head points to a Parasitic.Photos.
