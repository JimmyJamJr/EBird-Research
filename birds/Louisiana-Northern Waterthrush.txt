Responded to pishing and did not wag tail or call while observing. Unstreaked throat, pink legs, and eye stripe that did not taper. Although it appears different than the northern waterthrush, the bill (size/shape) and the eye stripe coloration were similar. Streaking on the breast of the northern were smaller and more numerous. Good photos of both the northern waterthrush and the Louisiana waterthrush for comparison.
