I estimated the flock at 330 individuals total while on the fly (I'm sure this is a rough count, but better than and "X"). When I found them, I couldn't find a single Cedar Waxwing, but it is very possible (maybe even likely) that there were CEDW in the group. While feeding, I of course could not identify every single bird, so estimated that I scanned through roughly half of the birds based on my vague memory of this historical sighting.
