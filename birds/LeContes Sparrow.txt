It allowed very close approach up to 10 feet.  Excelent photos taken.

I literally took 2 steps out of the car before this beautiful little sparrow popped up, about 15' away and 3' off of the ground.  Face was fairly bright orange with gray oriculars, and it had a black post-ocular eyeline that flared into a triangle shape near its nape.  It had a pale central crown stripe, bordered in black.  The bill was small, and was kind of a pinkish-gray, depending on the angle it held its head.  Its flanks and breast were a rather colorful buff, with fine, dark streaking along the flanks.  The nape was covered in fine streaks of maroon and off-white.  I didn't see its back too well, but I did notice the tail was gray and the tip was rather spiky.  When it dropped back down to the ground, it really disappeared from view in the weeds.  After a few minutes I pished, and it hopped back up for another nice, long look before disappearing again.

I stopped at this patch to pish sparrows and heard an unfamiliar squeaky chipping in response. Dennis Ghiglieri and Rose Strickland were in the car behind me and had a better angle on the bird. They called out "flat-headed sparrow".  The bird worked its way up for great looks and stayed in view for a few minutes before dropping back down out of sight. The bird was very cooperative and allowed for stunning photos.  After photographing the sparrow I made a few calls and managed to peak the interest of Jon Dunn who resides near Bishop and Dick and Carolyn Titus in Vegas.  They all said they were on their way.  We went on and birded Sage Hen Road Trees and Circle L with nothing of note.  Jon called when he got into the valley so we met him back at Arlemont Ranch.  Once at the right spot, we quickly relocated the bird in the exact same weedy spot.  At this point the bird came out a few feet away from me and took a bath in a puddle in the dirt road.  I have posted four photos of the Le Conte’s Sparrow on my Flickr site at: https://www.flickr.com/photos/nvbirdr/----At about 15 minutes before sunset, Dick and Carolyn showed up.  We met them at Arlemont Ranch and I quickly relocated the Le Conte’s in the same exact weedy area.  We had excellent looks at the bird and it remained in view for the next 30-45 minutes.  Once the bird is flushed from the dense weeds it remains close and in view while it feeds on grass and weed seeds.----This is the Fifth record for Nevada.
