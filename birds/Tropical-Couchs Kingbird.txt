It possessed identification characteristics for either a Tropical or Couch's Kingbird including a larger sized bill, a notched tail lacking any white, a bright yellow breast extending high up giving a contrast with a white throat, greenish back, and dark mask extending behind the eye. In an attempt to distinguish the species, I used playback, however the bird did not emit a response. Additionally, my camera was not with me and all documentation photos were from my phone and cropped for eBird purposes.

I first saw it as a larger sized Flycatcher, but when I got my binos on it I saw that it was a Tyrannus. It had a yellow belly and gray head with a dark eyeline/mask. It had a longer, broader bill that was noticeable in flight. Most of my views came as the bird was flying away from me where I got decent views of the tail which was brownish in color, without any white to the outer or tips of rects, and the edge of the tail seemed to bend inwards ( instead of bulge out ) suggesting a fork to the shape of the feathers. There was nothing much else I could get on the bird before it flew out of sight. Time was spent to refind it but proved unsuccessful.
