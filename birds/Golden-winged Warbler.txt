The bird was acrobatically hanging upside down to probe the dead leaves for insects.  Originally, the sound of the crackling/rustling of dry leaves drew my attention to the bird.  I was able to call everyone down to the bird (a lot of people were on hand to look for the warbler).  We all got good looks as the bird feed.  Martin and I managed to get photos.  Maureen, the woman who originally found the bird, commented that the bird looked different.  We felt the same, but we were hardly willing to say that there were two Golden-wings at Corn Creek a day apart.  After reviewing the pictures from both days, it appears that the bird on the 15th was a bright male and the bird on the 16th is either a female or possibly a dull first year male.  I know this seems astounding so the pictures are being distributed for some other opinions as to the age and sex of both warblers if indeed there were two.  The pictures do appear significantly different, so it will be interesting to see what others think.--

In the area of the coyote statue, at the intersection just after the pond,  She found it in the mesquites around the taller dead tree.  I found it when it gave a very soft, thin "tsip" call - it had bathed in the stream coming out of the pond.  It perched up and preened briefly, and I saw the yellow forehead, black face mask, yellow wing bars (two - upper one thinner, lower one broader), otherwise gray dorsally, pale underneath.  Female - throat was paler, not black.  Photo shows a bit of the tail pattern.  The belly looks like it is washed yellow in the photograph, but I believe this is light reflected off of the foliage.

I relocated the bird in the mesquite row just north of the upper spring that feeds the "swimming pool."  The bird stayed low 1-3 feet off the ground as it moved slowly through the mesquite.  It was very hard to see or track.  It was probably staying deep in the bushes to remain mostly in the shade to beat the heat.  At one point it came out the top of the mesquite and flew over to the spring.  I went over there and it popped up wet obviously from a drink and bath and then flew back up to the mesquite row.  Eventually it moved west to the very last bush in the row, where I was able to show it to Carolyn and Dick Titus.  This was after the sun had set behind the mountain and the bird disappeared.  Despite another 30 minutes of searching we were unable to locate the bird.  The bird did have a pale yellow wash to some of the breast and nape feathers which could or could not be indicate of some Blue-wing genes in a distant past generation pairing but the bird was clearly mostly Golden-wing.  The yellow wash may be remnants of a winter plumage, feather wear or normal variation within the species.  Photos attached.
