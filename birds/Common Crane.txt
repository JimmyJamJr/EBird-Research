After searching for more than four hours we decided to go get lunch.  We returned around 11:45 to search some more.  The five Sandhill Cranes and the COMMON CRANE flew overhead a little after 12:45 PM and circled around for about an hour before landing in the C3 field. The birds slowly moved through the field feeding and preening.  Many birders (approximately 30) from at least six states got to see the birds this afternoon. The birds were still there when we left at 4:30 PM.  Many photos were taken.  This well documented first state record was first found on January 15th by Norman Parish.  Documentation will be submitted to the NBRC.
