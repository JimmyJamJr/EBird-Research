It sounded like a Purple Finch.  On site, I listened to the Purple Finch recorded call that I had (Stokes), and the call was identical.  The call clearly was not that of a Cassin's or House Finch, which have been regulars in my yard for the past two months or more.  The bird flew to another tree, was joined by another bird, and both flew off.  I never got a good look at the calling bird. Thus, I'm choosing the combined form, although that's not entirely correct because it wasn't a Cassin's.

Pale supercilium ruled out house finch but other details not seen well enough to separate purple versus Cassins.
