It would forage, sun itself, and then fly to the next location where it would repeat these activities with occasional vocalizations.  It covered approximately 500 meters during this time.  It was last observed at the marked location.  This is an update of a previous submission that I was unable to add photos to.  This bird is presumably one that was first reported on 12/5/18 from the same general location.

I heard low cackling coming from dense vegetation 150-250 feet away. I played the "Throaty cacks TX" call on Sibley afterwards and felt it sounded very similar. Seconds later I saw a bird fly away from us from the vicinity of where I believe I had had the call. My look in binoculars was brief, and it was flying away, but I could see it was completely dark, was appropriate size, had shovel-shaped tail and I watched it glide low into Phragmites with flat wings and flared out, finger-like primaries. I did not see the bill shape, but I believe the looks I got were satisfactory.----It was just west of the Wells Trailhead where there are a large amount of light rocks bordering the wash.
