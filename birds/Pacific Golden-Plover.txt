The last one in Nevada was May 17, 1996.  It took me about 45 minutes before I found this bird.  It was standing at the south end of the pond in the mud flats intermixed with short brush clumps.  The bird was in the pond that was off Pintail Road 0.7 miles past the intersection with Navy Cabin.  The bird was clearly an adult (probably a female) transitioning into basic plumage. The primary extension/projection was short when compared to the tertials which were long.  The longest tertial exceeded the third visible primary tip, leaving only two tips visible on the resting bird when the tertials were lying flat.  The bill was thin but rather long for a plover.  The face and neck were golden buffy colored with an obvious supercilium and the upper back and wings retained the golden, black and white speckled pattern of an adult.  The breast and belly were a mottled black and white.  The legs were obviously long and gave the bird an elevated almost silly look as it moved around.  The bird flew once from where it was resting showing a pale underwing and landed on a strip of exposed mud not more than 30-40 feet away.  The bird called a few times then flew and called a few more times as it flew off to the south.  I was able to get some surprisingly good photos of the bird with my cell phone shooting through my scope.  I wish I had my real camera, but in my hurry to chase this bird, I left it and my binoculars home.  Good thing I had a spare pair of bins and my scope.  Attached is one of my better photos of the plover.

Will submit to NBRC.  Scoped this bird a good 20 minutes from the service road off the parking lot (I think it is the s/w corner of Nutgrass Lake) Large plover with a brown/spangled gold back and crown; pale supercilium that curves from its forehead to the side of the neck and then continues along the flank, with black splotches along the flank and undertail coverts.  Band at the side of the neck looked narrower than the same field mark on an AGPL.  Wings looked to be just slightly longer than the tail.  Belly was splotchy white and black.  Bill was much thinner than that of a BBPL, and looked fairly long for a plover.  Seemed a bit leggier and sleeker than a AGPL.  Bird spend 1/2 of the time foraging near the shore and about 1/2 of the time preening.  Once flew a short distance, but kept pretty much in the same 100' area while I was there.  Silent.

Nearly 100Â° sunny and calm, but successful 	Rob found this bird yesterday. Good scope views, pictures. The bird immediately appeared to be a pluvialis plover, with a fat belly and moderate width neck and a seemingly small head. The bill was only slightly shorter than a BBPL but notably thinner, and the head was not overly rounded; the primaries extended on slightly past the tail. The overall coloration was golden and black on the back and patchy black and white below, with black extending past the legs to the undertail coverts. There was a black patch on cheek, the eye was black and their was a distinct yellow eye line. We watched the bird at close range for probably 15 minutes at least, and it barely moved, but once it did flap its wings and I saw that the underwing was entirely pale distinctly through the scope.

Large plover, slightly chunky, but not as heavy as BBPL.  Dark --crown and mantle speckled with gold.  Whitish/pale forehead and supercilium, then narrower line continuing down side of neck, then obscured on down to the flanks (getting splotchy on flanks).  Unlike BBPL or AMGP that has broader, shorter extension of white on neck.  Bill more dainty and narrow than the other, pluvialis plovers.  Legs longish in appearance.  Primary extension visible but not as long as AMGP would have.
