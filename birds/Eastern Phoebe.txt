I was able to photograph both birds.  One appeared to have darker markings on the sides of the upper breast and appeared rattier overall.  The other bird had a yellowish wash on the belly.  Both birds were calling this morning.  The phoebes were very cooperative allowing close approach and excellent photography opportunities.  Finally, I got to see and photograph this bird in Nevada.  For some reason I had not been able to connect with one over the last 10 years.

I saw it and when I went to pull out my camera i lost it. ~ 5 minutes later I refound it by hearing it's phoebe call, where it flew into several mesquites and smaller bushes on the other side of the fence. I obtained a poor photo, but although out of focus, contains several i.d traits inlcuding: unpeaked crown, lack of eye ring, dark head, black bill, whitish throat, smudging on sides of breast, yellow belly, dark tail, indistinct weak wingbars. It also characteristically pumped it tails down during my observation. It flew across the creek to the south and I could not refind it.--<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/135716803@N03/22208874836/in/datetaken/" title="DSCF4214"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5620/22208874836_ce34f75700_z.jpg" alt="DSCF4214" /></a>
