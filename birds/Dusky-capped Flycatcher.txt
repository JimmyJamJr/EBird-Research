It was much quieter and only called twice in 45 minutes of observation.  The bird fed low, often flying to the ground to get prey.  It was hanging around the railroad tie foot bridge.  More photos were taken.

Calling a lot today.  It was hanging around in the "natural" area.  This time I was able to record its call.  It rained all night and into the morning.  I was able to find the bird relatively quickly as it was very active as the sun broke free of the clouds.

I saw Rita, Joan and another lady searching for the bird.  They said they had been looking for about two hours without any luck.  We split up to search for the bird.  I first saw it at about 11:00 AM as it flew up to a pine tree in the group picnic area.  I then heard it give its soft mournful call.  I called the other observers who were also looking for the bird (Rita S., Joan C., Dorthy Crowe, Felix and two others).  We all had nice looks as the bird moved through the trees to the "natural" area.  It traveled in a relatively straight line so I got ahead of it and waited.  It eventually moved to where I was and got to within 15 feet of me.  I managed to get very nice photos. It would call regularly, usually upon landing.  Also, when it was perched it would sometimes do this agitated rapid head bobbing thing that would last for a couple seconds.  I tried to record its call, but it was fairly windy and it didn't turn out.  Observed from about 11:05 to 11:40 AM.  Typical Myiarchus pattern, small for a Myiarchus, light grayish throat and breast, bright lemon yellow belly, gray face with a grayish brownish cap (more noticeable in some light conditions), proportionately large straight bill, olive greenish back, reddish edged tertials, gray underside of tail, top of tail was reddish at the base and along the outer edges, lacked wing bars.  I will be submitting more in depth notes and my photos to the NBRC.

Small Myiarchus flycatcher with very yellow belly, grey chest and throat, almost no rufous on underside of tail, almost non-existent wingbars. First heard, then seen along trail through wooded area at the eastern end of the park. Then followed out into lawn opposite of entrance to the nursery, near Tables 25, 27, 28. Many photos obtained, as well as video recording of the bird calling.

Apparent 2nd state record. Photos ML94716471 and ML94716481 below are from an hour or so after initial sighting when bird had flown a few hundred meters north into a honey mesquite. Photos ML94747631 and 641 are from location of initial detection in a stand of ash. First heard in dense ash stand giving plaintive whistle call. Tracked it down to within 20m or so and used the recording from the Sibley app and it came into about 5m immediately. Perched in the open in plain sight in numerous locations so seen well by all in party. Small Myiarchus, appeared smaller than Ash-throated Flycatchers seen nearby but nothing in the immediate vicinity to directly compare it to. Pretty bright yellow belly and grey upper breast, no rufous on underside of tail. Bill also appeared thinner than nearby Ash-throateds. Two members of the party (Bobby Wilcox and Kaitlin Murphy) have quite a bit of experience seeing and hearing this bird in both the US and South America. Bird was detected in NON-PUBLIC access area of Warm Springs Natural Area while doing a bird survey for Great Basin Bird Observatory. First detected about 200-300m north of Apcar Stream in a large stand of Ash a few hundred meters west of the non-public access service road lined with large palms. At the initial location of detection it would be possible to hear (and possibly see, depending on movement) the bird from the walking trails adjacent to the main parking area of the natural area. However the last detection of the bird was about 700m to the NE and it was continuing to move NE.

Access is mostly from roads, although we obtained permission to visit one section that's private. After refinding the territorial Dickcissel, we wandered up to the spot described here and poked around for migrants. A Western Flycatcher appeared, and as I walked to the northernmost clump of trees I noticed a small myiarchus flycatcher perched mid level in a small deciduous tree. Beyond the small size, I noted the fairly dark and compact head contrasting with a pale throat, rather yellow belly, small bill, and plain colorless tail. After overcoming a brief moment of speechlessness, in part because the timing is unheard of (there are no spring records from the great basin or from California's deserts either), I quickly yelled out the ID and Logan and Dessi got on the bird too. We obtained many photos. It never vocalized. We watched it flycatching from mid to upper levels of the grove, rarely venturing to the edges and never to exposed perches. Eventually it flew deeper into the property but we didn't make a prolonged effort to refind it after that.
