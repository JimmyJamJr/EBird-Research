I came back around 1400 hrs to attempt to find it again after it was reported by a non ebirder at 1000. I scanned the flock of YRWA in little league field #3 for ~15 mins as they flushed into trees and then returned to grass to forage. The PIWA eventually showed up when the flock returned to forage on edge of outfield near pine trees closest to bridge that crosses wash and near the  big red rock. I grabbed a few distant shots in he field before it flushed again into tress and I left area to leave bird alone. Grabbing pictures can be difficult with combination of outfield fence and distance of bird at times.

It was among the Yellow-rumped Warblers, feeding on the ground. Presumably first fall male, size with Yellow-rumped, but slightly bigger I will say, with a stronger bill, long, notched tail, and black legs, bright yellow breast, a whitish belly, and undertail. faint brownish streaks on the side of the breast, brownish flanks, bold crescent around the eye, olive-brown back. In one of the pictures which I took the undertail looks white. Two wing bars well visible. I watched the bird for more than half-hour, foraging on the lawn. No vocalization.
