Unknown birds of prey passed overhead while I was in the forest section. Could not see them clearly enough to ID.	Seen hopping between stones along the small creek in the wooded area. Clear white throat, calls, clean eyebrow, other markings, long bill and other features are spot on for Louisiana.----<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/58824548@N04/14833015525" title="Louisiana Waterthrush by James Bailey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2931/14833015525_7ae4e127ef_o.jpg" alt="Louisiana Waterthrush" /></a>--<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/58824548@N04/14646299500" title="Louisiana Waterthrush by James Bailey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5560/14646299500_0271b1ff7d_o.jpg" alt="Louisiana Waterthrush" /></a>--<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/58824548@N04/14830663034" title="Louisiana Waterthrush by James Bailey, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2900/14830663034_8a4e332e50_o.jpg" alt="Louisiana Waterthrush" /></a>

Found almost immediately at spring source. Stayed along creek east (upstream) of the pond the entire time we watched it. Pumped tail continuously. Called only once, which is what alerted me to it's location. Bold white supercilium, buffy flanks, relatively sparse chest streaking, and very clean white throat. Photos available.

The bird was immediately recognized as a Louisiana.  The bird had a very large and long bill, clean white throat, bright pinkish legs, a bright white supercilium that broadened at the rear and buffy flanks broadening adjacent to the legs.  The bird's call note was thinner and not as sharp as a Northern Waterthrush although when the bird flew, the flight call was very similar.  The bird would dip its rear end and tail in a slow u-shaped path back and forth (a diagnostic feature for Louisiana Waterthrush that I didn't know about at the time).  I believe this is only NevadaÂ¿s second Louisiana Waterthrush.  Full documentation will be provided to the NBRC.
