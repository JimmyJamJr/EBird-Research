Appeared intermediate between a Costa's and an Anna's, with a pinkish gorget in most light (although in some light it appeared purplish) and didn't appear as bright a pink as would be typically expected for an Anna's (although still out of the range for a pure Costa's). The gorget extended down the side far more than would be expected for a pure Anna's, and looked very much like that of a pure Costa's. The breast was a grayish green unlike an Anna's. I didn't see a post-auricular spot, however I didn't get a very good view of its side. The tail appeared quite long, like an Anna's. Pictures:

Length, shape, and color of the gorget feathers indicate hybrid origin, though not necessarily first generation."
