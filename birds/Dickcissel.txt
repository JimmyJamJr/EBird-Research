The large pale bill, long pale yellow supercilium, yellow breast with some faint thin streaks, two bold pale braces on the back, reddish shoulder patch, dark lateral throat stripes, and large pale malar all identified this bird as a young male Dickcissel.  The bird flew across the "swimming pool" to the weedy area behind the visitor's center.  This is where I was able to get some nice photos.  The bird called a number of times both the buzzy flight call and the dry check call.

I first spotted this bird at the top of a mulberry tree where I snapped a few pictures.  The bird then flew over to a tree across the "swimming pool".  I got fair looks at it here and worked my way over for photos.  Then the bird flew up to a larger tree next to the pond and eventually back towards the orchard where I lost it.  Notes:  Large pale blue-gray bill, long pale yellow supercilium, yellow breast mostly towards center and extending in a thin elongated triangle down the center of the breast to the belly, two bold pale braces on the back, slightly reddish shoulder patches, thin but dark lateral throat stripes, and large pale light yellow malar all identified this bird as a female Dickcissel. The bird called a number of times both the buzzy flight call and the dry check call.

I wasn't familiar with the call so I knew it was something good.  I suspected it was a Dickcissel based on the buzzy quality of the call.  Then the bird flew and we saw it in flight as it flew out to a lone large tree near the back cut field.  When it flew it gave it's diagnostic brrrt (buzzing alarm clock call).  It then continued to call from the tree for a few minutes.  Eventually two birds that appeared the same flew out to the east into the recently cut alfalfa field.  I played a recording of the flight call from xeno-canto to verify the identification.

I quickly scanned the tops of the trees and found the bird singing.  I described the song in my notes as "dick dick see (or sil) sell-sell" with the sell-sell portion being buzzy and insect like.  Only the birds head and face were visible at the top of the tree from where I stood.  I could see the face pattern well with the yellow supercilium and yellow to white submoustachial stripe.  The face and auricular patch were grayish-brownish.  The bill was fairly heavy and gray.  I heard/watched the bird sing around seven to eight times before it flew off to the west.  In flight, I could see that the bird's wing lacked any obvious wingbars and had a large chestnut patch/wash to the upperwing coverts.  The rump appeared grayish and matched the back of the head/nape in coloration.  I never saw the breast pattern or color.  My total observation time was probably under two minutes but the diagnostic song (how the bird got its name) and observed field marks made the identification really obvious.  I was unable to get photos because I was too far away and the bird left rather quickly.  I did look for the bird at the fields around the High School and another park to the west (the direction the bird flew) but I was unable to relocate it.

As I continued walking west along the spring stream, I saw a couple birds fly up into a bush.  I raised my binoculars and was rather shocked to see a DICKCISSEL.  I managed to get quite a few identifiable pictures.  The bird flew a little further west and disappeared.  I relocated it feeding on tall grass seed stalks with two Lazuli Buntings.  It flew up again and I managed to get a few more pictures before it flew around the tall brush.  The bird was probably a first fall male but I need to review my photos to be sure.  The bird was seen at 5:45pm for 2 minutes and at 6:00pm of about 4 minutes.  Noted Features:  Thick pale bill, yellow supercilium & malar, yellow breast narrowing to a point running down to the stomach, red shoulders, black vertical streaks on upper brownish/grayish back, thin black malar line.

Not very intense watching.	I was 14 paces or less from a hanging tube seed feeder, observing through 10x42 binoculars on a clear afternoon in a residential yard in Reno. The lawn was closely set about by conifers and some deciduous trees. I had been seeing house sparrows off and on throughout the day. For this sighting the front lighting on the birds was perfect to resolve color, pattern, and feather details. I scanned from the top of the feeder to the bottom and ticked off the birds as I went: HOSP, HOSP, HOSP, unknown but looks like a HOSP with yellow on the face and throat, HOSP, and so on.----I went to the book and found the only bird matching the mental image I had of the bird -- dickcissel. I went back to visual sighting and confirmed what I had previously seen, remembered, and compared. Yep. Dickcissel.----Then I compared the location maps and decided that it wasn't new or impossible that this bird would be here. After all, if it were travelling to the Pacific coast from the Midwest, it would have had to pass through an interior western state. Other confirmed sightings from California would support that supposition as well.----The view of the bird was quite satisfying, lasting for several minutes with time to check reference books and confirm the description and visual evidence.
