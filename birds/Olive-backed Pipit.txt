As I approached it flew to a lower branch of one of the larger trees, an action so uncharacteristic of Anthus spinoletta, that I felt its identification needed to be verified. On being collected it justified my suspicions, for while unquestionably a pipit, its heavily streaked upper breast and clear white posterior underparts left no doubt that it was a species with which I was totally unfamiliar. When put up as a study skin, it proved to be a male, in good condition in every respect, and with an accumulation of fat over its body that suggested long journey still ahead of it.----At the Bird Section, Bird and Mammal Laboratories, Fish and Wildlife Service, WashingtonD, .C., it was identified as Anthus hodgsonyi unnanensis The bird is now in the USNM collection (U.S.N.M. No. 530116).--B. P. Hall (Bull. Brit. Mus. [Nat. Hist.], Zool., 7: 268, 1961) states that the Indian Tree Pipit breeds from the Pechora in northeastern Russia, eastward to the Kurile Islands and Japan, southward to the Himalayas and Szechwan and winters in India, Burma, Siam, Indo-China, Japan, and the Philippine Islands. She also says that the most northern breeding birds (yunnanensis) are the least heavily streaked both above and below, the streaks in the mantle in fresh plumage being narrow, faint, and ill defined and the streaks below heavily concentrated on the upper breast, extending only sparsely on to the lower breast and flanks.--THOMAS D. BURLEIGH, 97 McKay Avenue, Reno, Nevada.
