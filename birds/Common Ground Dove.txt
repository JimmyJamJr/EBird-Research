Looks like the salt cedar is dying as the lake recedes.The bird flushed from the ground as we approached. Each time it flushed, it flew 20-50 before landing again, but I was able to get good looks at it when I relocated it on the ground. It was a very small dove with black spots on the wings, obviously scaled feathers on the nape and obvious patches of orange in the wings when it flew. The only other dove species with orange wings are the Inca Dove and Ruddy Ground-Dove. I eliminated the Inca Dove because of the presence of black spots on the wings apparent while the bird was on the ground. I eliminated the Ruddy Ground-Dove because of the presence of scaled feathers on the nape. Documentation submitted to and endorsed by NBRC.

The vegetation was about 7-9 feet tall and formed a wall between where I parked and the river.  It completely obscured the river but there was a trail through the vegetation (mostly willows I believe?) that I was planning to take to wade across the river.  I had locked my vehicle and started walking to the trail in the wall of vegetation when a small dove flew out from the right side and then angled straight away over the vegetation.  As it flew over the vegetation, it appeared like it was going to land on the other side as it began to drop down and fanned its tail.  I quickly went through the trail to the river, but the bird was not on the ground on the other side.  It must have reconsidered landing and continued over the river or flew low and upstream.  ----Upon seeing the small dove I immediately recognized it as a ground-dove.  It was small and compact, with a short mostly squared off tail which eliminated Inca Dove as a possibility.  Overall the bird was grayish-brown bodied with a short brownish-blackish tail with bright, although small, white corners on the tips of the outer tail feathers (largest, but still small, on the outermost rectrix) which was seen when the bird fanned its tail as it went over the vegetation.  The bird had obvious chestnut to reddish flashes in the outer wing (primaries mostly). The bird’s flight was rapid with a rapid wing beats (more like quick wing snaps rather than obvious up and down flaps).  ----Elimination of similar species:----There are only two other similar species of small dove with rufous in the wings that could occur in this area.  The first and resident southern Nevada species is the Inca Dove.  This was easily eliminated due to this bird’s short squared tail and plumper compact appearance.  The other consideration here is the Ruddy Ground-Dove.  Now this is a bit trickier as I could not pick up if the bird had a scaly nape, face or breast and I failed to note the underwing color.  What I am left with here is the bright white rectrix tips.  From the literature I have been able to find, it appears that Ruddy Ground-Dove lacks the white tips to the rectrices.  I found this in multiple sources so I believe it is considered a good identification characteristic.  So my elimination of Ruddy Ground-Dove is solely based on this feature.  --No chance for photos.

I don't hear this song very often anymore but am familiar with it.  I walked over immediately to the shoreline of the 33 hole across from where I had heard it and played CGDO song #1 FL *twice* from my mobile Sibley App to try and elicit a response from the bird. Although I was confident in the song, there were quite a few Chats in the LV Wash and I wanted to make sure I wasn't getting fooled. I also wanted to try and get a better location on the bird.  About 10 seconds after this, a small dove flushed 25-30m from somewhere across the way and I immediately got on it with my binoculars. When first observed, it was overall brown in color with reddish orange primaries and primary coverts, small headed and billed, and had a short brown tail with thin black edges to the outer rects.  It flew upslope and landed on a small ridge about ~100m from me.  I followed but could not relocate it.  After I got home, I went over Ruddy Ground Dove as a possibility because I am not familiar with that song and wanted to rule it out.  But the Song held true for CGDO based on the one parted simple "hooip" given in steady sequence.

The red wings and short tail immediately led to the identification.  At this point I was fairly desperate to relocate the bird and see if it was a Common or Ruddy.  After a few minutes of searching, I relocated the bird in an apple tree.  The bird flew a few more times before it landed on the ground allowing for a clear identification to species.  The bird appeared to be a female Common.  The scaly head, neck and breast were quite obvious and eliminated Ruddy.  The bird then flew up to another apple tree.  We observed the bird for around 10 minutes.  I was able to obtain nice photos which I have posted on my Flickr site.

About a 10-15 second series of slight rising, somewhat hollow sounding coos repeated about once per second. Nothing else I can think of that is realistically possible here really sounds like this. Sadly it never sang again and I was unable to find it. However, my field partner, Kaitlin Murphy, told me after our surveys (without prompting by me) that she had heard one as well. This is assumed to be the same individual moving north as her survey was about a kilometer south of mine. We are both pretty familiar with this bird from having done bird surveys in SW Arizona for a number of years. Hopefully some of our fellow GBBO surveyors in this area will detect it again and get documentation.
