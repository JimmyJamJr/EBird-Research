Probably the best morning I've had at this location!	Gorgeous singing male. Hung around the same spot for several hours, allowing the rest of my crew to get looks later on. Black face, bordered to the rear by a whitish patch and above by a reddish crown. Strong red band across the upper chest and flanks. Unmistakable. State bird for everyone!

Found yesterday by Kathy Kuyper.  I found the bird at about 7:30 AM shortly after arriving.  It was in the mesquite trees surrounding a clearing on the north side of the road.  I obtained many good photos.  It fed at eye level and up to tops of mesquite trees.  Loosly associated with Kinglets and Mt. Chickadee.  Fairly actively feeding.  Viewed again in the late morning with Kathy Kuyper and Carolyn and Dick Titus (11:05 AM to 12:00 PM).  Field notes:  Greenish backed with black streaks, greenish-yellowish face, very faint eyeline, short tail (white underneath with black corners), buffy undertail coverts, reddish-brownish washed sides, bold thick white wing bars, bright white edged tertials, yellowish eye ring (broken), see photos for other field marks.

She saw bird well and thought it was a bay breasted warbler,  but when she tried to take a picture, it flew further south over phragmites, giving one high, clear chip.  I was too tired to follow it and she had to rejoin her friends.

With stronger light and more activity I noticed there seems to be a shadow forming an eyeline (infront of and behind eye) and a whitish superciliam sort of appears in some lights.  Tail from underneath:  black edges on outer tips and black scallops next to end of undertail coverts - otherwise white.  U/tail coverts don't come to a sharp point, just rounded point.  Seemed to flip or move tail fairly often as if to straighten out the feathers.
