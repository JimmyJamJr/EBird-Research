I spent a lot of time with this bird scoping it to make sure of its I.d. and the whole time and it kept checking off boxes for ARTE. After about 45 mins, it began to fly and forage along the shore, but still at a distance. In flight, it had a thin black edge to primaries and white, sooty secondaries. It also had a more bouncy flight to its style than the Forster's we had seen earlier.  All this confirmed it as Arctic to the group.  It never flew in close for a great shot but eventually P. Gaffey did get some nice shots showing these characteristics after I left. Most of my supplied pics are from poor digiscope screen shots. The distance, wind, and light were confounding factors for decent pictures.

The corner of the filed is flooded to the point that there is actually a pond present.  I found the bird at about 4:40pm and viewed it drop down in the grass to roost right before dark.  I got some very nice photos of this amazing Tern.  The field is located right along the highway (HWY93) at the intersection with Stewart Bros. Road.  I watched and photographed the bird for around two hours as it flew around this pond picking things off the surface.--

With Paul Lehman.	First state record. Stayed Oct 11-14. See AM Birds Vol 45(1): 133 and PHOTO on page 176. Accepted by NBRC 2010-084. From my notes: First seen flying right past PEL and I on the west side of the lake, while we stood on the dike. I was struck by the compact look, short-necked appearance, short-rounded wings, and extensive black cap. Paul's first reaction was COTE due to seeing the darkish carpal bar but I felt it was an ARTE. Every time it flew close I would take photos. Proportions were stockier, etc. as noted above. Bill was shorter, cap extended farther down down the sides of the head. Being a juvenile the tail was relatively short (and of little use in separation). Upper wing was medium gray, upper wing coverts and bases of the primaries, extending out onto the outermost two primaries. Carpal bar was present but not as black and contrasting as a COTE. At rest (seen on 14 October) the carpal bar was obviously much fainter than COTE. Legs were extremely short, too, much more so than COTE. From upper side secondaries appeared white on trailing edge, a bit grayer at bases. From above and below the secondaries were translucent. Fro underside the wings essentially looked white except fora very narrow black trailing edge to the primaries. Underparts white. Bill black. Silent.

It was originally found the previous day by a WFO conference field trip.  The bird cruised by several times (about once every twenty minutes or so) and then finally stayed around for a half-hour in the early afternoon.  It landed to preen for about ten minutes on the shore of the lake.  The rest of the time that it was observable, it was hunting in the small ponds on the south side of the dike.  The dike separates the main lake from this area of small ponds.  The bird seemed to be frequenting the ponds on the east end of the dike.  We also watched the bird fly the --entire length of the dike from east to west on two occasions, and once it worked from west to east on the lake side (i.e., north side of the dike.) --The one time we saw it on the ground, it had landed along the lake side of the dike. --
