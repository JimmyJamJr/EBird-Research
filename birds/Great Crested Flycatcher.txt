I saw it fly once through the trees early at about 7:45 AM but could not relocate it.  I searched for another hour and then went to a couple other spots to bird.  I returned at about 10:30 AM and finally found it on the back side of the tree row feeding from the trees into the agriculture field.  I observed the bird from 10:40 to 11:00 AM.  I was able to get some very nice photos of the bird.  It would fly out after butterflies and then return to the trees.  All diagnostic features were seen very well (large bill with pale base to lower mandible, bright lemon yellow underparts, gray breast and throat, gray face, brownish backed, bright rufous tail, bright white tertial edges (quite wide on the topmost/inner) that gave the appearance of a white "V" on the back when veiwed from behind.

The bird was staying in the dense trees at the very corner of the property.  It would move occasionally to catch a bug and then smack it on a branch.  It wasn't very active so it was a bit of a challenge to stay with it.  I got great photos when it would perch in a gap in the foliage.  Description:  A brightly colored Myiarchus with a bright lemon yellow belly that extended up to a dark gray breast and throat, green sides to breast, rufous primary edges and tail, blackish tertials with bright broad white edges that expand toward base, dark olive brown above, slightly browner top to head, large bill with pale base to lower mandible, undertail rufous with a thin dark outer edge when closed and viewed from below.  The bird was silent during all observations.  Details and photos will be submitted to NBRC.  I contacted other birders and Dennis G. and Rose S. were not far away.  When they arrived we relocated the bird at around 11:15 am.  Other birders drove over to see the bird including Jon Dunn and Dick and Carolyn Titus.
