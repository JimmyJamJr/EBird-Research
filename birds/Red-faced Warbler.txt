Charleston Area) at about 7:15 this morning.  Eight observers enjoyed good views of the bird as it fed along the hillside alongside the spring.  I followed the bird up the mountain for about 30 minutes trying to get photos.  I was able to get a couple fair shots.----

I made the 35 minute hike up to the spring which put me there a little after 6:30am.  Bird activity was relatively low until the sun got far enough down into the canyon to shine on the spring area.  The sun reached the willows around the spring at about 7:05am.  Once the sun reached the spring area, the bird activity increased significantly.  My strategy was to slowly walk back a forth on the path between the upper part of the spring and the middle part of the spring spending no more than a few minutes at each end.  The upper part of the spring is identified by the dark shaded canopy tunnel over the small stream.  The middle portion of the spring is the area that the path crosses the stream.  There is a large rock on the west? side of the stream near the path crossing, that if stood behind, gives a good view of a smaller dark canopy area over the stream.  By walking back and forth slowly and quietly, it allows a single person to view and cover the most important areas.   By 7:15 the spring was alive with warblers, hummingbirds, jays, vireos and other birds all wanting to drink and bathe.  At 7:50 I walked down to the middle of the spring and saw a bird flit into the water under the dark little overhang below the middle rock area.  It was the Red-faced Warbler.  The bird appeared to be a very brightly plumaged adult.  The bird began to bathe when a finch flew down and disturbed it.  The Red-faced dropped down again and splashed around for another 30 seconds when the finch drove it off again.  The warbler flew about 20 feet up the hill to some tall bushes on the west? slope where it began calling and feeding.  The call note is sharp and relatively loud, louder and sharper than the nearby Virginiaâs and MacGillivrayâs Warblers.     The bird repeated the call note about 6-10 times before stopping.  At this point I lost the bird.  About 4 minutes later it began calling again just a little further up the canyon on the hillside.  I viewed it again for a few minutes before I lost it.  Total viewing time was probably about 5 minutes in a 15 minute period.  Then the bird was gone.  I think the bird may come into the spring early in the morning to bathe and drink before it wanders off to feed all day.  The bird may return to drink intermittently throughout the day, but as I learned yesterday, that may be very infrequently.
