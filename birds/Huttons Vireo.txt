Multiple observers searched for it today, and I was able to relocated it at 11:03am in the Lakeview Apartments in a mixed flock of Ruby-crowned Kinglets, DE Juncos, Yellow-rumped Warblers.  This checklist location is exactly where it was refound. --This is the 1st state record of Hutton's Vireo for NV, pending review by the NBRC.

Similar in appearance to nearby Ruby-Crowned Kinglets, but slightly larger in size with incomplete eye ring and light toning that converges to front above bill. Additionally, behavior was different--not nearly as much constant "frantic" movement that would be typical of Ruby-Crowned Kinglets. Photos.

The bird seemed to be in a plumage closer to "worn alternate" rather than a fresh "Fall."  The largish head was an olive with a slightly gray tinge.  A pale supraloral elongated spot was visible.  The eyes had a broken eye ring, broken at the top of the eye.  The chest and belly were a whitish/ash.  Legs and feet were a solid bluish gray.  Photos by several other birders, as well as by Ben Sonnenberg.  The location was a few places at the south end of the lake, but the bird kept returning to the same row of junipers.

First seen by Ben Sonnenberg on Dec 19, 2020 at this same location. Overall impression similar to Ruby-crowned Kinglet, including flitty behavior as it foraged. However, the bird was noticeably larger than RCKI, had a thicker bill, lacked the dark bar across the secondaries, had thicker legs, and dark feet. "Solitary"-type Vireos ruled out by incomplete eye ring, and flitty behavior, among other things. At least eight other birders saw the bird in the time I was there.

Seen in a mixed flock of kinglet and juncos by the apartment complex where Paul reported it. Great view on a pine tree for like five seconds, larger than the surrounding kinglets with a bulkier bill that is curved at the tip. Overall an olive grey coloration with two white wing bars and yellow tinged primaries, but no black bar like a kinglet. There was broken eye ring and off white around the face. The throat was greyish white. The olive tones, the bulky structure and head, and the face pattern (with a lack of a hood) are enough to distinguish from Solitary. Ben has posted diagnostic photos already and Paul got some more good photos today.
