I did not see this bird when I walked out to the mouth of the wash in Las Vegas Bay.  I actually observed it a little later from the nearest overlook that looks back on the delta area.  The bird was easily scoped and identifiable from here.  And from this vantage point I could tell why I couldn't see it from the delta.  The bird would have been obscured by other gulls and the bird was facing directly where I was scoping from so only the white breast would have been visible if I could have seen the bird.  But from above the bird was immediately obvious.  The significantly darker back was quite apparent when compared to the nearby California Gulls.  The bird appeared to be the same size as adjacent California Gulls.  The hind neck smudgy streaks, parallel sided bill, pale eyes and yellowish legs were all observed.

It landed on the boat dock. It was a striking first cycle or possibly second cycle bird with a mostly white head with a smudge around the eye, pale brown streaks to the back of the neck, dark adult mantle feathers, dark brown wings with long black primaries, thick even sided all black bill (other than a small pale end to the nail), almost all black tail in flight with just the outer tail feather showing white with black barring, was roughly the same size as nearby California Gull, slightly fleshy to greenish leg color. There was some strange green color on the tail clearly it got into something as it was not a plumage detail but something stained or painted on. We got excellent photos of this bird as it loafed on the dock before it flew off to the south and then later off over the marina to the north at about 4:50 pm.

Looked the be a third cycle with black on the inner tail retrices, a nearly all dark bill, and no white outer primary "moons" yet. The head had fine brown streaking with a concentration around the eye, which was bright yellow. The underwings had a grey stripe beneath, the primaries were black with the back only slightly contrasting with them; it seemed an exceptionally dark bird even for this species. All the gulls were flying around over the mergansers, occasionally diving at one that caught a fish and sitting in the water briefly and then flying up. This bird was a bit larger than the California Gulls but similar sized or slightly smaller than the Herring i.e. too small for SBGU or WEGU. Perhaps this is the same bird Rob found here a few months ago, I would have to compare pictures.

Continuing immature bird observed on the pontoons--north side of the Marina. Good looks at a  distance of less than 15 yards by naked eye and through 10x42 field glasses allowed for good comparisons with the Thayer's, Herring and Glaucous-winged gulls in the area at the same time.  This immature bird that is a tad larger than near by California Gulls and noticeable larger then the many Ring-billed Gulls, however, is a tad smaller than the Thayer's Gull and noticeable smaller than the Glaucous-winged gull that were observed in the same area at the same time.

The bird was on the inner cove beach near the lifeguard tower. The bird is very dark brown with a white head, a small brownish smudge around and extending behind the eye, some coarse brown streaks on the lower portion of the back of the neck, bright white breast with a brownish mottling on the belly, black parallel sided bill is beginning to pale at the base, white rump seen in flight, fleshy yellowish tinged legs, long black primaries that cross and extend well beyond the tail and is virtually the same size as nearby California Gulls. I managed to get a handful of pictures that I will submit to the NBRC. I don’t believe this is the same bird I found there back on January 6th because this bird appears to be a second cycle.  I am not totally sure a first summer bird could be eliminated but I believe it should be lighter and not darker as this bird is.  Also, it seems unlikely that it would have been missed for the last three months if it had been roosting or visiting the marina because the area gets birded quite frequently. I believe it is a new bird heading north or northeast or wherever it is they go for the breeding season.

Found the bird today floating in a loose raft of other gulls (mostly California and a few Ring-billed) on the north end of the lake.  Scoped for 20 minutes, and noted the following details:  the bill was bright yellow and very slim, with a large red spot on its lower mandible.  It had  very pale yellow eyes which in the late afternoon sun looked almost white.  The head and neck were heavily streaked; the streaks themselves were brown and rather fine, and were heaviest around the eyes (the feathers just above and below the bill were streak-free).  The mantle was a dark charcoal gray, much darker than the California gulls.  The primaries were black with small white spots, and the folded wings were noticeably longer than its tail, which was white.  About 3:30 it flew to the south end of the lake.  As it flew, I could see its bright yellow legs, narrow white trailing edge to the secondaries and inner primaries, while the outer primaries were were almost entirely black, with a few specks of white and a small white spot on the outermost primary.

It was alone picking at something stuck in the ice. I ran home to get my camera because the light was perfect and the gull close in for a nice photo. When I returned a few minutes later, a small dog was on the ice and the gull was gone. Most likely the same bird reported at Virginia Lake for the past week.

Another birder pointed it out on the island before I spotted it myself. Obviously larger than the California Gull next to it, very dark back. Head was tucked in. I started to photograph it anyway, hoping it would show its head momentarily because it was moving - instead it took off heading towards the north end of the lake. Several photos obtained - here is perhaps the most telling: --<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jga775/16184198107" title="SS0996 by John Anderson, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7350/16184198107_d15ce37092_o.png" alt="SS0996" /></a>

We were scanning the gigantic gull flock when I spotted this bird flying in. My initial views were some of my best, as it flew by quite close and in perfect lighting. This bird was a prototypical first cycle LBBG, with an all brown grey head neck and belly and thin all black bill. The brown body and head looked rather mottled as is characteristic of european gulls. The primaries were black, including dark inner primaries in flight and dark on the underside of the outer primaries as well. The rump was predominantly white with some dark mottling and the tail had a distinct band, that is the outer part was dark and the base was pale. The bird landed and I immediately got the scope on it and we got to study it. The bill was entirely black and notably thin, the eye was dark and the legs pink. The bird was in general rather dainty, with long thin wings and a not especially plump body; the overall size was only slightly larger than the surrounding California Gulls. The juvenal scapulars and coverts were still mostly retained. I didn't have my camera so I rushed back home to get it, as our scope is really to cheap to use for digiscoping. When I returned, it had flown off, so in total was probably present there ~15 minutes. We walked out to the other pond and when we were coming back, all the gulls were flying back in. We spotted this bird coming in and I got a horrendous picture, and it landed in the thousands of gulls, but before we could relocate it a hawk scared up all the gulls and Emma managed to see it flying back northeast towards the dump and got much better views. We left at that point but I suspect it might come back later today, especially in the evening, or tomorrow morning. This is a second county record and the second from this location. The first was back in 2009.

We were scanning the gigantic gull flock when I spotted this bird flying in. My initial views were some of my best, as it flew by quite close and in perfect lighting. This bird was a prototypical immature LBBG, with an all brown grey head neck and belly and thin all black bill. The brown body and head looked rather mottled as is characteristic of European gulls, with a concentration around the eyes. The primaries were black, including dark inner primaries in flight and dark on the underside of the outer primaries as well.

We left at that point but I suspect it might come back later today, especially in the evening, or tomorrow morning. This is a second county record and the second from this location. The first was back in 2010.----Discussion: The all dark bill in December effectively eliminates California Gull in December; of the hundreds of first cycle CAGU we saw today, not one had an even mostly dark bill. The bill also points against Herring, as do the dark inner primaries in flight. The tail pattern also rules out both Herring and California. In addition, the other features of the bird (the grey brown mottled coloration, retained juvenile feathers, and structure especially) were also a perfect match for LBBG.----Update: I initially thought this was a first cycle initially, but I realized that my views of the scapulars were not as good as I thought, and the picture almost looks like a second cycle, and also it looks very much like the same bird seen at Bellevue earlier in the year. In any case, I'm still certain of the species ID
