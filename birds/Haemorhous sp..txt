I didn't get a good enough look to confirm one way or the other, and it didn't vocalize.

I heard a distinct, repeated Purple Finch call in the pine trees just up the hill from me.  I played the Purple Finch call and saw a couple of "finch-sized" birds fly out to the front of the trees.  I did not see the birds well enough (basically very poorly except that they were finch/sparrow-sized birds).  Purple Finch had been seen in this area earlier this winter.  However, without a decent visual, I'm being conservative on this one and choosing a more generic name.
