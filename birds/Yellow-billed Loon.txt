The bird was on the north side of the road about 500 meters away.  Seen around 8:30am.  As I was looking over a gull flock with my spotting scope about 700 meters away the bird swam in front of the gulls.  I immediately recognized it as a loon by the long, pointed bill, unlike any waterfowl.  I noticed right away the bird had a yellowish bill held at an angle the entire time.  I believe the bird was a juvenile due to the slightly smaller bill than an adult, the limited yellow, and the bright spots on the back. The head had the "double hump" appearance, the eye was surrounded by a broad light eye ring, the head and hind neck were a light brown with a hint of a partial collar.  The chin and ventral side of the neck were whitish, the culmen was straight, and the dark gray back was covered in rows of lighter colored spots.  The only field mark I did not see was the post ocular mark.  I observed the bird for about 10 minutes.  It never dove or preened, and seemed nervous or anxious.  At one point it looked like it was going to fly to the west, but then decided to settle back on the water, and drifted/swam to the east.  Before I could begin a stalk to try to get a photo it again took off to the west, gained altitude to about 100 meters, flew across the road to the south and disappeared in the distance.  I never got out of the truck until it took off to the south, so I'm sure it wasn't my actions that made it flush.----I have seen winter plumaged Yellow-billed Loons in the past.  I found a first or second state record in NM over 20 years ago, and observed several wintering birds on Lake Havasu in western AZ while living in AZ for 29 years.

Noticeably larger bill, held somewhat upright, curved lower mandible.----Very poor photos (others may have gotten better photos), but I'm including them mainly to show the location of the bird. If Google Maps is accurate, this bird was in NV waters the entire time we saw it today. It was often in Ryolite Cove (or possibly Ninety Foot Cove), going in and out of view from the dam. When this photo was taken, we were standing around the NV/AZ border (according to Google, and my phone's GPS), and the Loon was near the location where I dropped the gray pin. The Loon later went back into the Cove, out of view from us.

Discovered by Pellegrini/Hines/? doing Southwest Willow Flycatcher Surveys.  Took us (Dennis and Becca Serdeheley and Neal McDonal) a while to refind this bird, as it was diving a lot, and was sticking around the vegetation at the north end of the lake.  In fact, it spent a lot of time with only its back showing, but would pop its head up every few minutes.  Later it moved a little closer to our position on the dike, and we had very good looks.  A large, 1st summer loon.  Back was kind of a medium brown with white mottling.  The top and back of the head and neck were pale brown, but the throat and face were mostly white.  The best field mark, of course, was the huge, dagger-like pale yellow bill that was held tilted up at a slight angle.  The bird stretched up from the water a few times and exercised its wings.  The belly and underwings were mostly white, with a pale brown edge to the wings.  Lifer!

I was able to rush over there to get photos and video before the last of the light disappeared. An eager birder should be able to see this bird at night with the surrounding artificial light. ID straightforward with good looks--a a very large loon, with a light brown scaly back, steep forehead, and long uniquely shaped bill. The base of the bill is grayish and fades to yellow towards the tip. While swimming, the bird tended to hold its bill slightly above horizontal. Funny to think of this as a "returning juvenile" from 2008 since that bird showed up on the same date and time! So something about this lake must be attractive to this species. Hopefully it will stay the winter like the 2008 bird did.--<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/83622107?byline&#61;0&portrait&#61;0" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0"></iframe>--
