My first thought was Vesper, but with additional observation this bird was even plainer, and no white on the tail feather edges.  It was observed in the lawn of the orchard area, towards the west end, but not near the feeders where several White-crowned Sparrows and other species were feeding.

Chilly start bit not much wind.	Mostly a very plain sparrow with a clear breast, white upper wing bar and some buff on the lower wing bar.  Bits of reddish brown on both small areas on lower and upper wing.  Also a small but distinct eye ring and small yellowish bill.  Not sure if it is a year bird or just going into adult winter plumage.
