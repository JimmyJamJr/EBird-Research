Many photos taken.  The bird was on the shore below the high and dry boat ramp/dock in the Town of Walker Lake.  It was first observed on the shore between two large groups of California and Herring Gulls.  Observed between 12:15 and 1 PM. When I first saw it, I said that I may have a Western Gull, based on my first look at the very dark back color and purplish pink legs.  Once we got it in the scope and saw the head shape and the bill size and shape, we were pretty sure we had a Slaty-backed Gull.  We moved up on the birds to get photos and check the upperwing pattern.  The bill seemed thinner and was definitely less bulbous than a Western Gull and the legs were more purple than a Western.  The bill was black tipped or probably better described as a large blackish smudge at the end.  The eyes were pale with a small dark smudge around the eye (mascara mark).  The hind neck was streaked brown.  It was smaller than the largest Herring Gulls but equal in size to the smaller Herrings (probably females).  Also, the head shape was fairly rounded which would also seem to indicate it was a female.  The bird flushed and we got a number of flight photos showing the "string of pearls" on the upper wing.  These white spots, separating the dark primaries from the dark mantle, were absent on p8 and p9 but were clearly evident on p5-p7.  This in combination with the bill color, some brownish tones in the wings and some small dark marks in the outer tail feathers seem to indicate that the bird is a third cycle bird. Most of the secondaries were heavily worn, with the tips worn to the shaft, so the large white trailing edge to the upperwing was only really evident in the first few secondaries (or possibly tertials that close to the body) and the first 4 or 5 primaries.  Documentation will be submitted to the NBRC.

First seen sitting on a rock just offshore, about 200' away.  I got a little closer and watched the bird for about 20 minutes.  Spooked and flew off when another car arrived, and then circled back over head.  Very dark gray mantle.  Back of head and neck streaked..  Legs were pink.  Bill was rather long and narrow with no discernable angle, with a dark area near the end of the lower mandible.  When it flew, it had a rather broad white trailing edge to the wing, which really contrasted with the dark gray of the wing, and it had white spotting at the ends of its wings, but I didn't get a great look at that.  It looked like the underside of the wing was grayish, but they were in shadow and the bird was backlit some.  Eyes were yellowish, and there was a bit of a dark streak at the rear of the eye.  Unfortunately, there were no other gulls around for a comparison, because I know mantle color can be deceiving.  Submitting to NRBC.

Observed mixed in with other gulls on south beach area.  Large size similar to Herring Gull, dark gray back (bird with darkest gray back there), dark pink legs, streaked back of head, and broad white trailing edge of wing obvious when compared to adjacent Herring and California Gulls.  Initially easy to pick out from other gulls because of dark gray back.
