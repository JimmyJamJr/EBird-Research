We observed it at around 1:30 from the backyard of the Circle L ranchhouse.  It was across the field that is behind the ranchhouse, sitting near the top of a tree.  It eventually flew a bit to the east and disappeared behind the trees.  Not too much later, Dennis and Rose re-found it as they were driving out the ranch entrance road. It was in the pasture area north of the entrance road, and we all got to enjoy watching it walking around on the ground with (and fighting with) a few Turkey Vultures.  It eventually flew up into a tree on the east end of that pasture, and that's where we left it.

This is just north of the entrance into the Circle L Ranch, Dyer.  We climbed over the fence (which birders are allowed to do) and walked the row of trees relocating the Caracara on a couple occasions.  We obtained some nice flight shots of the bird.  After spending about a half hour with this bird we went back to the vehicles and made phone calls to other Nevada birders.  Thank you Allan for posting the bird for everyone.  Later in the afternoon Carolyn Titus and Tracy Kipke showed up and we all were able to relocate the bird in that same row of trees. Extensively photographed.  The NBRC accepted this record.

Large raptor with long, paddle-shaped wings, long tail, long head. The primaries were largely whitish with black edges. The tail was largely white with a broad black terminal or subterminal band. The head was extensively white with a distinct black cap. Otherwise the upperparts and underparts were blackish - four distinct points of white on a dark raptor shaped like a cross. Long bill with red facial skin. Location mapped is exact. Submitted to the Nevada BRC - fourth state record if accepted.
