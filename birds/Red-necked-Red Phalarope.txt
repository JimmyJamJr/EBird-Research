Bill looks more stout and bird looks bigger than nearby Red-necked phalarope. But views were distant and don't feel comfortable calling this as a Red.

Gray above, black on the upperwing, mostly white head with black coming back off the eye and some dark on the back of the head/neck [details not seen well].  My fist impression was that it could have been a RED PHALAROPE, but I never got a good look at the back and was never close enough to make out bill and other structural details. Unfortunately, I was so busy trying to see those details that I never got pictures. It flew south out of site, but hopefully it sticks around Washoe Lake or maybe the water treatment ponds south of Carson City.
