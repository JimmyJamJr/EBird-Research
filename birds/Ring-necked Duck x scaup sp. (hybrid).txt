The flank "spur" (the portion of the flanks nearest to the breast), which would be present on RNDUs, was nearly gone. ----- An extensively black nail. ----- A rather faint but present ring along the distal portion of the bill below the nail. ----- Head shape seemed somewhat intermediate. ----- Greenish sheen to the head was obvious.----As to what Scaup species it is, I am not sure. Location, likelihood, and overall shape, body mass, and bill size seem favorable of LESC, but the overall rounded crown seems more supportive of GRSC. The actual species may never be known.

This individual showed essentially the same field marks as the Henderson Bird Viewing Preserve (HBVP) individual: ----Scapulars clearly dark slate-gray but not black.----- Flank pattern and shape intermediate, with the color being muted whitish-gray, becoming slightly but nevertheless conspicuously whiter near the breast. The flank "spur" (the portion of the flanks nearest to the breast), which would be present on RNDUs, was nearly absent. ----- A rather faint but present ring along the distal portion of the bill below the nail. ----- Head shape seemed somewhat intermediate, but overall more reminiscent of RNDU. As the HBVP bird was viewed at a different angle in a different position, the head shape could have been altered. ----- Greenish sheen to the head was obvious. ----- Both the HBVP bird and this individual were sedentary and alone when viewed. ----The distance between Floyd Lamb Park and HBVP is less than 30 miles, and that isn’t even in a straight line. The fact that the bird viewed today at Floyd Lamb Park essentially exhibited the same field marks as the individual at HBVP has, combined with the overall likelihood, as well as the flight abilities of waterfowl, the possibility of the bird at HBVP being the same as the one observed today is present. It should not be concluded that both are different birds.
