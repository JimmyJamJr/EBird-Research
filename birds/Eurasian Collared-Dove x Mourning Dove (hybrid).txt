David Donsker and I arrived at Corn Creek at first light and immediately noticed a number of kingbirds flying into the trees from the desert.  As the steady stream of birds continued, we noticed numerous warblers flying in along with the kingbirds.  The first tree we reached was loaded with Western Kingbirds, although only 10 feet tall it had at least 50 kingbirds on it perched like Christmas tree ornaments.  Each binocular field in each mulberry tree contained at least 5 Bullock's Orioles and a few more Western Kingbirds.  Groups of 5 to 10 warblers (mostly Audubon's) were in the trees, on the ground, in the grass, on fence posts - just everywhere.  We birded the oasis from 5:15 to 11 and conservatively estimated 2,000 birds of 75 species.  Counting was next to impossible as the birds were constantly flitting from tree to tree.  We returned and birded the area again from 2:30 to 5:30, and although activity was much lower, there were still hundreds of migrants, several more still flying in from the desert, and we found several species we didn't have in the morning.   Also saw 1 hybrid Eur Collared-Dove X Mourning Dove but could not determine how to enter this into e-bird.	Roughly Mourning shape and size, brown- backed, but with black hind collar.
