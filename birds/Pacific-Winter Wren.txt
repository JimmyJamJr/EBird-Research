Small, dark; heavily barred underneath; stubby, upturned tail; sharp "chak-chak" vocalizations almost constant. Preceded us up the narrow canyon, in and out of undergrowth, under rocks and downed trees, perching briefly in the open where I could observe with binoculars at distances of approx. 20-30 ft.--First assumed Bewick's Wren; dismissed upon visual for chunky, dark, heavily barred look, as well as for size, and for lack of white eyebrow (supercilium). Considered House Wren; dismissed on voice as well as for size, chunky, dark, heavily barred look and that short, upturned tail.--Rock and Canyon Wrens were both present higher up the canyon, seen and heard.

However I never heard a call, and everything I saw about this bird looked fine for the more-expected Pacific Wren.

Here's the deal. With a small group from GBBO I was up Hard Scrabble Canyon, and I made the call on Winter Wren. Based on vocalization. At the time, I had zero experience with Pacific Wren. The bird sounded like a perfectly normal Winter Wren, a bird I knew quite well at the time. I have since gone on to appreciate that Winter Wren and Pacific Wren sound appreciably different. It seems to me that this bird was likely a Winter Wren, sensu stricto, given my automatic recognition of the bird I knew well from Back East. I don't think this necessarily qualifies as a Winter Wren, sensu stricto; but I also think it would be wrong to assume it was a Pacific Wren.
