It was very brown, almost like a Mountain Plover, but it had a darker belly.  When it flew there was no white in the rump, and the underwing was dark.  The bird was over 400 yards away, but observed through a spotting scope.  The photos are very long distance, and mostly poor, but you can make out some details.
