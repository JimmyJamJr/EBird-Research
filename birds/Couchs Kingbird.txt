Very bright yellow belly, slightly paler yellow breast, whitish throat, gray head (slightly darker around the eyes). Lacked the contrast between the throat and malar that would be seen on a Cassin's. Black bill heavier than Western's.   Brown wings and tail (no white) and a greenish back.  Moved back and forth between 3 different perches, all within 100', and caught and ate numerous insects.

We first spotted this bird just before 7:00 am as it perched atop a large mesquite well to the south of the Turtle Pond.  It then flew over to its preferred section which was just to the south of the circular half covered shade structure that lies to the southeast of the Turtle Pond.  The bird called its "kip" or "pip" calls which are similar to Western Kingbird.  It repeated the call notes in series on several occasions.  At one point it gave a "pleer" call as well.  It called after catching a bug and in protest to being displaced by a Mockingbird.  It had a favorite perch low in some mesquite just past an intersection of the two trails across the stream behind the shade structure.  It successfully chased multiple bugs after the sun came up and it warmed up a bit.  At one point it hacked up and expelled an unfavorable insect part.  The bird was very cooperative and posed for excellent photos.  It didn't seem overly concerned with people or the nearby Cooper's Hawk.  Description:  Pale gray head with a darker mask through the eye onto the auricular area, a rather thick based broad semi-long black bill, green back, brilliant yellow breast and belly, slight green wash to uppermost breast, white throat, brown wings and slightly notched brown tail (lacking any white).  The bird seemed to favor a lower position in the mesquites but it would also perch up in the taller trees and more exposed perches.  I stayed with the bird until 9 am.  Lots of photos taken.

This bird has taken up residence in a mesquite-shrub patch along the stream flowing south from Turtle Pond toward the shade structure, and thus has all the cover requirements it prefers in south TX and northern MX.--BEHAVIOR:  Unlike Western and Cassin’s, this bird preferred lower perches in mesquite and other trees; it was frequently perched so low as to obscure it from view.  From mid-level perches, it sallied forth to grab insects in flight or from the ground.  The bird was not wary but flushed if approached too closely.  --VOCALIZATION:  we heard quite a few ringing “ka-breeer-yup yup!!” and “kip kip!!”, much different from the buzzy liquid trills reported from the almost identical Tropical Kingbird and also from the chattering hesitancy of Western Kingbird. --APPEARANCE:  the appearance is smaller, more compact, rounder-shouldered than Western, with shorter folded wing projection, slightly notched tail with no terminal band or visible white edges, and less prominent bill with faintly rounded culmen.  It is reported the bill is noticeably less-prominent than Tropical but I think you’d have to have both in view to see this.  The back in good light shows a greenish cast that extends down between folded wings toward the rump.  The primary, secondary, and tertial feathers are faintly edged in light tones.  The breast is startling bright yellow -- noticeably brighter than Western even in flight -- extending all the way to the vent.  There is a white throat patch that contrasts with the yellow belly and gray face and head, and a dark gray eye line.  The yellow on the breast wraps faintly around the scapulars and blends into the back, forming the greenish tones there.  The overall plumage appears quite fresh and not worn.

This pond is the first pond you get to when walking straight northwest of the main parking lot at the Wetlands Park. This trail is left of the bathrooms at the parking lot for the directionally challenged. Upon arriving at Turtle Pond I listened and scanned all around the south side of the pond. Nothing. I then walked around the pond for close to an hour with nothing. After a full circuit and a quick jaunt to the northeast I returned to the south end of the Turtle Pond boardwalk and played the Tropical Kingbird song. Nothing. Then I played the Couch's Kingbird song and then call and the bird flew in from the west side of the pond and landed right next to the trail on the south side of the pond. As it flew it, it gave a soft call that reminded me of a Ash-throated flycatcher. Something like brik, brik, ka-brik. The call of course came as I was still playing the Couch's call from my phone and so I wasn't convinced that I wasn't making it up that I had actually heard the call (In retrospect, I think I was just being overly cautious). Either way I spent the next hour getting great photos of the bird and eventually diagnostic single and repeated "pip" call notes as the bird flew and landed again. The bird has brown wings and tail, a green back, light gray head with darker mask, a white throat, and extensive bright yellow on all of the underparts. The bill is relatively short and conical in comparison to a Tropical Kingbird, but the call is really the most diagnostic characteristic.
