From a distance, the rusty color to the forehead offset by the gray chest was obvious.  The chest was gray and there was some yellowish color around the vent.  The undertail coverts were rusty.  The tail feathers were gray and had a terminal yellow band.  The throat appeared black; there was a black eye patch, and a thin white line that extended from the bill to under the eye.  The Bohemian Waxwings seemed to have a different call that may have been an alarm call.  The call was a high-pitched �tsee� that was closer to a Cedar.  Overall the Bohemians are louder than the Cedars.

I recognized them as waxwings immediately and estimated flock size as they flew by. Once my survey was over, I walked over to where I thought I had seen the birds go down, several hundred meters away. I found the birds quickly and raised my binoculars to investigate. The first bird I looked at was chunky and had very obvious rusty undertail coverts. The next bird, the same. The next, the same. I methodically picked through the flock and could not pull out a single Cedar Waxwing. I can't remember how many I actually checked, but I remember being surprised that I couldn't find even one Cedar Waxwing among the BOWA. I watched the birds for some time, from a distance of less than 100 m (probably closer to 50 m), as they ate berries from the swamp cedars. A surprising and rewarding find. Absolutely no doubt on this ID.
