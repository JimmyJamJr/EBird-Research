It was seen while picking through several yellow and wilson's warblers in the same tree, and the small size of this icterid is what i noticed first. I then observed it to have two white wing bars, short tail, and small decurved bill that was stained with mulberries besides it all yellow plumage. I tried to alert fellow birders to its presence but it flew into the orchard and was lost. I could not refine  due to the high volume of small yellow passerines and other oriole species at the site that morning. I am very inclined to call this a female orchard oriole, but knowing the similarities of OROR and HOOR, and the more common abundance of Hooded, and the rare status or Orchard, i kept the observation as entered, I hope it can be refound in the coming days for verification.
