Nevada's First.  The homeowner and I observed the bird from 10:15 AM to 11:30 AM.  It was resting on an outer branch of a Sequoia tree about 7-9 feet off the ground.  It was not overly shy and allowed for very nice photos.  It was very observant even though it seemed to be nearly asleep.  An accipiter flew over and it was instantly aware of it and watched it fly over.  Documentation will be submitted to the NBRC.
