The wing tips and coverts were too pale for a pure Herring Gull, but the wing tips too dark for a Glaucous-winged. The bill closely resembled that of a Herring Gull and was pale based, indicating that the other parent was a Herring rather than a Western, while the colorations showed apparent Glaucous-winged parentage.
