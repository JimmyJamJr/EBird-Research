It stayed low and fed on the ground at times. I could not get it to vocalize.--However, the recent split of the Arctic Warbler into several species has thrown all lower 48 observations into question and guided by the CBRC should now be considered Arctic/Kamchatka Warbler until further study evolves to separate these closely related species. --With further examination of the documentation photos  and video taken of this bird and guidelines established in helping to distinguish all past and future ARWA/KLWA observations, this bird will likely be called one species over the other eventually.
