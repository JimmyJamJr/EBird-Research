Jaeger structure.The bird appeared all brown on its dorsal, it has a buff/light belly and I noticed a dark breastband that ended the belly at the upper breast, and separated a lighter throat, a light nape, and a dark forehead. The light belly kind of diffused into the breastband and then diffused into the throat, there was not a clean separation and it did not reach all the way up the flanks but rather just remained in the breast region.  The bill appeared long and somewhat thin. When I first saw it, it had long wings, and showed a great deal of white at the base of the primaries on the underside as well as the dorsal side towards the end of the wing. The white coloration on both sides of the wing was noticeable with my binos upon first glance and it did not appear just contained to the wing edge but extended inwards.  I canâ€™t give specifics on how far these went (without photos) but I can guesstimate that on the ventral side the white conservatively extended up to the base of the 6th primary and on the dorsal side, the white came into the 7th primary. I noted 2 pointed central rects. These 2 feathers were not long, I guestimate 2-3 inches in length, and were seen individually from each other. They were not thin and pointed, but rather appeared to come to a point at the end of the feather.

We observed it from the boat at some distance.  It looked more like a Parasitic, but we never got enough on it to be sure.

Unable to ID as to type of jaeger as it was flying away from me.  Seen by several other people yesterday and today.  When I saw it, it was flying directly away from the shore and landed on the water a couple of hundred yards out, after swooping down to check out a few of the grebes.  Waited for 30 minutes but did not fly again while I was there.
