Looked like a large, chunky sparrow-like bird. When i got my binoculars on it, i instantly saw the large white wing patch created by the extensively white greater coverts. Large head with large conical beak. Bird only stayed for a few seconds, then flew southeast towards Pond 9. Appeared to leave the preserve. Couldn't relocate. Spent multiple weeks in northeast Wyoming this year, so feel very comfortable with this bird. No photos.

We observed a breeding-plumaged  male Lark Bunting just after crossing the Bruneau River. It flushed from the side of the road and upon seeing a black bird with stark white wing patches we slammed on the brakes and jumped out. It landed on a sagebrush 30 yards away and gave great views for about a minute. It flew again, showing off the striking wing patches, then landed again for another couple of minutes. It was in a large shortgrass meadow surrounded by moderately sized sagebrush.--A more exact location is about 3 miles north of the Y where a big sign points right to Mary's River and left to Charleston Reservoir. Take the left fork toward Charleston Res, and after crossing a very measley portion of the Bruneau River at about 3 miles, there is a small two-track on the east side of road. It immediately turns north along a fenceline and reaches the open meadow in a few hundred yards.

Concentrating near the bridge and new overpass.	This probable continuing/previously reported bird was located, on an overcast day, along a fence and irrigation pipe line west of the bridge. It was feeding near/with approx. 35 White-crowned Sparrows. This flock was observed for over 30 minutes from a distance of between 50 and 75 yards, using field glasses and a 20 x 60 power scope. During this time we got  several few second views of the Bunting as it would fly up to the fence and/or water pipe for a few seconds then drop back down into the brush. This bird is Sparrow sized with a thicker appearing--darkish--bill than the WCSP's that were near enough for comparison. The white edged coverts along with the almost black throat stripe with white on either side of the stripe and whitish breast with dark stripes with the impression of a darkish spot upper breast were all clearly visible at different times.  Some very poor quality photos are available if needed.
