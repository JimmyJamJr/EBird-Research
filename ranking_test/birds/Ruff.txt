Seen feeding with Long-billed Dowitchers towards the west end of the lake. The bird was roughly the height of nearby dowitchers but was slimmer overall.  The bird was brownish above and whitish below with brown splotches on flanks, breast and sides of neck (larger on flanks).  The throat and chin were clean white as was the undertail coverts and underwing coverts.  The bill was mostly black with a pale orangish-redish base, slightly drooped towards end, fairly short and thinnest at tip.  The crown and upper back were brown with darker spots created by dark central marks on feathers.  The wing coverts were dark verging on blackish with even pale edges (fringes) that even appeared white on the greater coverts towards the tips.  Wings showed short primary extension barely visible behind long tertials.  Pale feathers at the bill base and pale marks in front and behind the top of the eye.  The legs were bright orange much deeper in color than nearby Greater Yellowlegs.  ----I spent over two hours with the bird and at one point if flew with the dowitcher flock.  I easily picked the bird up in flight due to its more patterned back and the white upper tail coverts forming a U-shape contrasting with a black tail and dark brown back.  The bird may be a male due to the dark wing coverts and redish based bill.  The bird seemed to spend even amounts of time feeding, preening and sleeping.  When the bird fed it moved around with its neck extended out at an angle with the bill angled down toward the water.  The bird would then stab down into the water, submerging its entire head.  This extended out posture during walking and feeding is obvious and is kind of the characteristic look for this species.  Seeing this bird was quite a thrill after missing one in Nevada by less than 30 seconds 21 years ago.  Nevada life bird #435.  Tally Ho!

It was sleeping with the LB Dowitchers when I noticed a light breast compared to the gray smudgy breast of the LBDO.  Then it lifted its head and I saw the dark short bill with a slight curve.  A few more views of the head and I saw the white around the base of the bill.  Finally, it moved and I saw the yellow-orange legs and loose tertials compared to the LBDO.

The Ruff was hanging around a mixed flock of Long-billed Dowitchers, Greater Yellowlegs, and Dunlin.    Rather a drab brown on top, with some of the feathers on its back having a black center with brown edges (actually looked quite striking when it was facing away from me).  Undertail coverts were white.  Pale brown smudges on its flanks, breast and neck but the breast was still paler than that of the dowitchers.  Whitish feathers around the base of its bill and a bit of white near its eyes.  Bill appeared dark, although once I thought I saw some lighter color at the base of the bill.  The bill was much shorter than that of the LBDO, GRLE, or DUNL, and it drooped at the end.  Legs were a bright orange.  A few times the bird flew a short distance, and the u-shaped white uppertail coverts were then seen. Most of the time, just standing or feeding with other shorebirds, occasionally preening.  Flew a short distance 3 times, but always landed back in the same spot as before.

The bird was about the size of Long-billed Dowitchers it was flocking with. Grayish-brown above and mostly white below. "Scalier" looking above than most of the dowitchers, because of the light edging to the feathers. Bill appeared all dark (although other people's photos show some orangish color), slightly drooping, and much shorter than the bills of dowitchers. When feeding, the bill tip either just touched the surface or went only slightly under the surface, very unlike the deep "sewing-machine" probing of the dowitchers. The bird was also seen next to a Greater Yellowlegs, and was much smaller and shorter-legged than the yellowlegs. Wings mostly white underneath. I saw the bird within 10 minutes of arriving, and I believe it was there the entire time.

What was initially obvious was that it was taller and a little bulkier than the Dowitchers that were feeding near it, it's bill was short with a little orange near the base, the legs were greenish in color, the face/head and breast were a somewhat smooth buffy color, and the back was light buffy brown and "scaly" in appearance.  The sun was directly at my back which really lit the bird up and made observing the different characteristics very easy.  Initially, the bird was about 300 feet away and I as observed the bird through my scope, it flew up and circled around a few times before landing about another 100 feet out.  As it flew with the sun at my back, a weak white wing stripe on both wings and a white "U" or "V" on the upper-tail coverts were clearly obvious.  When the bird faced directly towards me after landing, the smooth buffy coloring was observed partway down the breast in the shape of an almost-closed vest and the belly proper was lighter to white. The bird again flew up and circled around a few times overhead before flying off to the west.  As it circled overhead, I noted that the underwing was almost all white and again could see the weak stripe on top of the wings and the white U- or V-shaped uppertail coverts.  I watched it as it flew west higher and higher and I eventually lost it in the setting sun.
