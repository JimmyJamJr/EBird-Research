Emma heard this bird singing but we initially thought it was an odd Bewick's wren. I spotted it and was speechless. It was in the cottonwoods by the little trail just past the sign about the nude beach. Was actively feeding and flying throughout the tree, eating some caterpillars and singing regularly. Bright yellow warbler with a pale vent, blue wings with two distinct white wing bars, black mask and bill. Have some pictures and maybe a very poor audio recording. Possibly a first county record?

Details to NBRC; update August 2020: accepted unanimously by NBRC).

I photographed it (horribly though definitive with copy at VIREO) on both the 27th and 28th. With Paul Lehman. Marian and Jim Cressman drove up from LV to see it.	Accepted by NBRC #2010-008. If I remember correctly this was one of the old records that was lost during the Cressman era. My transcribed notes: A female found in the weedy corner of the grown-over small pond. My first glimpse told me enough, that it was a BWWA, but it took much longer to get decent looks. Finally seen well, eventually photo'd though poorly. Paul saw the bird repeatedly after I first found it. Seen again on 28 May. Description: somewhat larger than the WIWA it was with. A yellow head and body, with the exception of a greenish back (this greenish tinge extending up to the crown), and white undertail coverts. A black line extended in front and almost to the lores? and behind its dark eye. Wings and tail were a bluish-gray. Wing coverts showed very faint bars. Tail showed a good deal of white on the inner webs towards the end of the tail particularly in flight. Bill long and slim. Fed in weedy stalks in clumps--often buried in the middle making viewing difficult.

The rear crown, nape and back were more of an olive green color.  The bird had a distinct dark eyeline, and with a rather large pointy "warbler bill."  The upperparts of the wings were bluish-gray with two thin white wing-bars.  The undertail coverts were white and the tail spots were white.  The bird fed mid to low level gleaning insects or probing in foliage.  I never heard it call.
