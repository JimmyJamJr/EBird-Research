I was able to relocate it at about 1:00 PM with Dick and Carolyn Titus.  We observed it off and on for a little less than 5 minutes.  Photographed.  Will submit to NBRC.

Responded to scold of Philadelphia Vireo, the only way I was able to see it again and get good photos after my initial short view.

Also walked out to entrance area and back.	Foraging fairly actively in relatively tall chokecherry at entrance to Loop B of campground starting at 7:55 am. Like a Warbling Vireo but with light bright yellow underparts including throat and undertail coverts; more prominent whitish supercilium due to dark lores and darker cap and eyeline; notably greenish tinged gray back contrasting somewhat with plain gray nape and cap. Bill seemed relatively small and short for a vireo. Eye was dark. Cap was evenly rather dark grayish. No wingbars on dark wings. Given what I saw, I could not think that it was anything other than this species, but am open to ideas if someone thinks of another option.

Originally documented the previous day by others.  Occasional looks at the bird as it called and flitted about.  Pale lemony yellow breast area and line through the eye evident.

I have been visiting it for about 15 years now and it is sad to see the general decline of care.  I also starting thinking about the great birds found here over the many years it has been birded and I began to wonder what the next one would be.  About this time I heard an unfamiliar soft Vireo song from the top of a large cottonwood across from the driveway to the main ranch house.  I immediately recognized it as not one of our regular birds.  I pulled out my iPod and began scrolling through eastern Vireos.  My second play was Philadelphia Vireo and I immediately knew that was a perfect match.  I spent two hours trying to see and photograph it as it sang from the tree tops.  The bird was incredibly difficult to see because it would stay virtually motionless about 50-60 feet up in a cottonwood.  Eventually it moved to a tree along the lawn and orchard.  Here I was able to see it better and eliminate Red-eyed Vireo whose song is fairly similar.  The bird eventually came down lower and sang from an exposed branch finally allowing for fair photos.  I recorded the song as well for submission to the NBRC.   The bird had a yellowish breast belly and undertail coverts, a dark lore, grayish cap, no wingbars, greenish back and wings.
