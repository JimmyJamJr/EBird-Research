One seen in flight with good lighting and close range with wings and tail spread as it landed in a mesquite tree. Small dove, short wings with red patches, tail short. The bird dropped to the ground and ran into thick brushy vegetation. We saw dark spots forming bars on the folded wings, but no scalloping on the pale head. Second bird (or same), seen in cottonwood tree, flew to mesquite tree and sat for observation and photos. Again, no evidence of scalloping on pale head.
