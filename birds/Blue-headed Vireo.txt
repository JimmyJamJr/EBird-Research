Our first stop in the valley was at the roadside rest stop (turnout with picnic benches and an outhouse) located just off HWY 93 on the east shoulder in Lower Pahranagat N.W.R. (Lincoln County).  There is a row of cottonwoods here and on the opposite side of the highway.  In this row of cottonwoods we had a number of nice birds.  But none were as shocking as the beautiful BLUE-HEADED VIREO we found at the north end of the rest area.  We spent about an hour observing and photographing this amazing rarity for Nevada.  We had just seen a Cassin's Vireo a few minutes earlier in this area, but when I first got on this bird I immediately knew I was not looking at the same bird.  I called Martin over and he almost instantly said Blue-headed Vireo.  The bird was very brightly colored with a green back sharply contrasting with a dark blue-gray head.  In fact from behind the bird looked like it had a blue-gray hood.  The blue-gray face was strongly contrasted to the white throat and the demarcation was sharply defined.  The bird's vent was pale yellow and the flanks were greenish yellow.  While the bird fed it would open its wings slightly revealing this deep bright yellow.  We have a few photos where the bird has opened its wings revealing this amazing yellow color.  The bird's underparts (excluding the vent) were a clean bright white.  A little later in the day we found another Cassin's Vireo which provided us good after the fact comparison looks.  Our bird was clearly significantly different.  ----This Blue-headed Vireo was accepted by the NBRC.--
