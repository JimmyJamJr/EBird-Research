We were preparing to leave Corn Creek as we had to get back to our hotel, check out and go to the airport to catch a flight.  As Cindy and I were talking about leaving, I heard the bird singing in the location described above.  After finding the bird, I studied it and then left Cindy with the bird while I ran back to the car for the camera. On arriving back, Cindy informed me that the bird had flown (chased by an Ash-throated Flycatcher?).  We spent a brief few minutes trying to relocate the Eastern Wood-Pewee but I did not hear it sing again, and we could not relocate it visually (we were limited in time as we needed to get back and check out of the hotel and get to the airport).  ----The bird was initially heard singing and identified from its song (before it was seen).  I then located it for visual study.  I heard the bird sing on four occasions and watched it sing once.  The bird’s song was classic Eastern Wood-Pewee and described as a clear, slurred, whistle “Pee-a-weeee”.  The last “weeee” note rising.  I grew up in Louisiana and regularly heard Easter Wood-Pewee both during migration and summer breeding season (the species successfully bred on several occasions near where I grew up). ----This was a small flycatcher (slightly larger than Empidonax flycatchers but decidedly smaller than Ash-throated Flycatchers).  It was sitting upright on a branch.  The bird was facing to the right of us (giving us a front/right side profile).  It was perched about 8 feet off the ground.  Overall the back was a brownish gray color.  There was no eye-ring.  The bird had a slight crest.  The upper mandible was dark.  The lower mandible was entirely pale-orange, except for a very, small portion at the tip.  The breast and abdomen were light gray.  There bird lacked the dark vested appearance typical of Western Wood-Pewees.  The bird had two wing bards that were similar in contrast (upper wing bar equally bright as the lower wing bar).  The tail was dark gray.  I never saw the bird cock its tail or flick its wings.  ----Separation from  Western Wood Pewee: The bird was separated from this species by voice (I believe this is probably the only safe way to separate the species).  Additional plumage characteristics support Eastern Wood-Pewee include the overall lighter gray coloration, lack of dark vested chest, lighter lower mandible, and two bold wingbars.
