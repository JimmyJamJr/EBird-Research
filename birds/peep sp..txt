They were much smaller than the coots I could see flying past but they were way too far away to see any sort of shape or coloration. Least Sandpipers are my best guess for the majority of the flock. I can't even begin to come up with an accurate number, but the number of peeps required to blanket a square mile must be in the thousands. Based on that there had to be tens of thousands of birds out there.

Plumage looked like a classic juv semi sand with a dark crown, distinct white supercilium, and dark cheek. Throat pale, tan wash on side of neck. Was a fairly bright bird (as you'd expect in July) with clear white tips to the scapulars, but the overall coloration was plainer with less rufous than on Western. Black legs. Structurally, the bird was slightly smaller than the Western Sandpipers (right next to it, even slightly behind it, though this also could be sexual dimorphism) with a proportionally smaller looking head and thicker neck. The body was round and the overall shape was compact, with the legs more in the middle of the body. The bird did not have the classic Semipal bulbous short beak, but it was shorter than the surrounding Western Sandpipers, comparable to nearby Least Sandpipers in length and well within the range expected for semi. Very poor photos.
