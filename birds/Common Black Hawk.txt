The bird was seen flying low through the densest area near the middle pond.  I flushed it a couple times before it perched on a power wire near the 多bone yard多 for photos.  It then flew over between the two 多real多 ponds drawing the attention of the local Ravens.  It then flushed from there and was apparently driven to the ground by the Ravens right next to the puddle beneath the raised water truck/tank.  I got very nice photos of it as it stood on the ground avoiding the swooping Ravens.  The bird was a second year bird with some first year plumage remaining on the back of the head, in the wings and in the tail.  This is an abnormally late date sighting for this location, with most records for Corn Creek occurring from early to mid April.

It got caught in branches for .5 second before heading away (in front of me) where I followed it through the trees for about 50m before I lost sight of it in thick veg. My best looks is when the bird flushed: all dark black/grey bird with black back, chest, head, and throat, yellow beak and cere, large white tail band that gave the impression of a elongated white rump patch when bird flew, and large broad wings. The bird was on the bigger, heavier side compared to the SWHA and RTHA seen already that morning. I did not notice it until I was right next to it (~8m) on the trail where it was perched next to the trunk of a willow tree and a large extended branch. It never flew up but rather stayed low when it flushed. An attempt to refind was made but not successful.

The bird flushed from the edge of a pond and flew through the trees and out of sight.  I relocated the bird perched in a tree and got good but brief looks.  The barred tail and belly and the brownish blackish coloration clearly indicated a second year bird.  I located a Crayfish debris field on top of a large flat boulder next to the pond which indicated a favorite feeding location.--The adult birds were flushed from next to the road 5.7 miles north of Elgin.  Martin and I watched them interact with each other on the wing, even talon grappling a few times.  They flew around for about 10 minutes and then dissapeared up a side canyon.  We took many documentation photos.

Similar to a kestrel repeating a kee-kee-kee-kee note over and over, but maybe slightly slower. I got out of my truck and headed towards the call, which was coming from the east side (other side) of the stream. The vegetation was very dense and before I realized how close I was, a juvenile Common Black Hawk laboriously took off from the edge of a beaver pond where it had been perched. Overall the bird was brown with buffy mottling on the upperwing and a distinct light buffy patch on the upper back (mantle). The bird also had a dark terminal tail band with creamy white bands going up the base of the tail. I only saw the bird for a couple seconds and could not relocate it over the next hour and a half. The call I heard was most similar to http://www.xeno-canto.org/80617, but with a more steady rhythm, a little unlike the rising and falling calls most commonly heard.

As I was walking up the road I saw one fly across an opening and I could clearly see the white band in the tail.  Then they immediately began calling.  As I was trying see them through the  dense foreground trees one of the hawks flew into the tree right in front of me and sat!  Then he flew back and the two hawks began flying back and forth against the cliffs, riding thermals and circling together until they were high above the cliffs.

Had been driving slowly for the several mile section above Elgin, paying particular attention to the areas where I could see the stream from the road.  At 1.2 miles from Elgin, I spotted this bird standing next to the stream.  It lifted up and flew behind the vegetation.  Spent the next 30 minutes looking for it again, but no luck.  Noted long yellow legs while it was standing; while flying, the very broad wings were apparent.  Seemed at first to be all black with a thick white band near the base of the tail and a thin white band near the end of the tail.  As the bird banked into the sunlight, I saw that the secondaries were dark brown, not black.  Very cool--I had made several trips over the years looking for this bird!

When I stopped, it gave an alarm call, and flew into a 2nd nearby tree, where another Common Black Hawk was perched.  Birds were black with a thick white band near the base of their trails, and a 2nd thin white band near the end of the tail.  Very broad wings and long yellow legs.  Call was consistent with calls on on Macaulay Library.

Distinctive bill, color and shape of the Blackhawk were evident.  The call was identical to that on I-bird Pro, which is quite different from other hawks I am familiar with.  The area was noted earlier in season for Common Blackhawk activity and has been in this area historically.

After a while, I stumbled onto it and saw this young bird in the nest. I quickly took a few photos to document its occurrence and immediately left he nest area so as not to disturb the bird.
