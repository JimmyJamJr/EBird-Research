I came back to the weir to obtain better looks and photos of this bird to help try and  rule out any hybrid traits. I relocated it on the far side of the wash just above the weir with ~5 WFIB ~0900. I watched it for ~30 mins initially at a distance of about ~75m.  I needed my scope to watch it but it gave good looks in the soft light.  The bird was in closer this time and in better light with the sun to my back.  All traits that I had seen two days earlier still held true with gray legs with no red coloration, dark facial skin on a brownish/straw-colored bill that was the same color on both dorsal and ventral side, bluish-whitish facial lines that had a strong demarcation with the forehead. I noticed a small percentage of streaking in the forehead that I not sure is remnant immature plumage. There is also a very small white spot behind the eye on the left side of the face. However, I believe this white spot is not a pale based/white feather that would be seen in a WFIB or hybrid. It's very small and somewhat hard to decipher what it is. It could be a streak of immature plumage. Another observer and I also chatted about it just being a piece of skin that actually had no head featherings covering it. I also again concentrated o the eye of the bird and again did not see any hint of red at any angle the head or eye was moved at. I took a many photos and will make time to post  more in the days to come. --I was also joined by another experienced birder at ~0950 and we again chatted about the bird. All characteristics I mentioned in previous paragraph were seen by both of us in the ~25 mins we watched the bird together.----*Note* the pictures added have been cropped and makes the white facial lines look purple for some reason. This is a misrepresentation. The facial lines are actually more whitish-bluish in the field. Other pictures from observers can conform this.

This blueish-white border is thickest between the eye and the bill along the upper border of the facial skin. The rest of the facial skin was definitely blackish, with no apparent signs of purple or red, which would suggest a hybrid. No obvious white behind the eye except when the white eyelid closed even partially. Otherwise, when the eye was completely open, there appeared to be no white behind the eye. White facial border did not go over the forehead at all. Eye appeared brown. Feathers around facial skin appeared to be all dark, showing no hints of pale that might suggest a hybrid.
