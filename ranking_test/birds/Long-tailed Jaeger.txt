This is my post to the list serve:  I made it out to see the Jaeger just before dark and at quite some distance. I felt the bill was thin and of average length. It appeared that the central rectrices  were pointed. I couldn't get much on the color of the bird due to it being so horribly backlight. I never saw the upperwing in flight as I wanted to count the number of white primary shafts.  But based on the thin bill and pointed central tail feathers, I thought the bird was probably a Parasitic.  But as it is with Jaegers, it has turned out to be something else. Aaron Ambos just sent me his excellent photos he took of the bird today and it turns out the bird is actually a LONG-TAILED JAEGER. The bill seems thin for LTJA, but it is the right length and does show about 1/2 of the length being dark (tipped). The tail feathers appear to be worn causing them to look pointed. I have seen this before on a Long-tailed Martin Meyers and I had at Walker Lake a few years ago.  So why is it a long-tailed?  Aaron's pictures clearly show two distinct white Primary Shafts in the upperwing which is diagnostic for Long-tailed. A critical feature I couldn't see in the field.  Also the nearly half dark bill is good for long-tailed as well as the birds overall cold gray color.  Typically immature Parasitics are warmer brown or even rufous in color. So, I originally thought the bird was probably a Parasitic and it has turned out to be Long-tailed. I guess that's just immature Jaegers for you. Often times, all critical features need to be seen in the field or captured on camera to be sure of the identity. --I also obtained some blurry photos of the bird.  Observed from 5:30 pm to 6:15 pm.

Another birder arrived at about 10 am, viewing and photographing the jaeger as we talked about it.	Spent over an hour with this bird, identifying and enjoying it. "Intermediate-plumaged juvenile." Very small & short bill with black tip; rump nearly all white with a few dark streaks; central tail feathers slightly longer than others. Photos available, if necessary. At least 15 other birders observed this bird during the following week, confirming the ID.

The bird had large flashes of white in the wing from above and below and appeared larger than the Long-tails we had just finished watching back at Sutcliff.  Also, the wing beats were deeper and more erratic.  Soon, the Parasitic Jaeger we were watching began pursuing another dark juvenile Jaeger.  This new Jaeger was obviously smaller.  The larger Jaeger's wings were longer and the body was larger (heavier).  We watched the two Jaegers for 20-30 minutes.  We eventually got good looks at the Parasitic when it landed in the water.  The two very short pointed central tail feathers were noted at this point.  Both birds were never far apart.  They were almost always chasing something or each other.

It is about 3 megabytes and unless you use Linux you will probably need Quicktime to see the video.  It's not very good, but people who saw the Parasitic earlier in the week might be able to tell whether or not it is that bird.----One thing that really stood out on this bird as it flew over the boat was strong black and white barring on the undertail coverts, and similar black barring on the underwings.  In flight we didn't notice any rufous tones to the bird, although it was rare that we got to see the upperside.  I was so excited to be on a high-speed Jaeger chase in a motorboat that it was hard to concentrate on collecting details.  Most likely it was a Parasitic because that is what has already been seen in the area but the strong barring we noticed kinda bothers me, and suggests Long-tailed?
