I think the fact that part of the bird is a Myrtle Yellow-rumped Warbler based on the bright yellow rump, orangier armpit spots, and supercilium is undisputable.  The other parent is more up for discussion.  From what I have seen online and what feedback I have gotten from others, it seems that Townsend's is likely.  The bird was also associating with Yellow-rumps.
