While slowly driving past the old Anaconda copper mine pit lake, I noted a group of Swifts and Swallows flying in a tight circle low overhead. I noted some White-Throated Swifts and Swallows, and in the midst of that group was an all dark, obvious larger Swift with obvious Swift-like wing beats and a squared somewhat notched tail. The small group flew in tight circles above the vehicle 3 or 4 times as we slowly drove by. There was no doubt in my mind that it was a Black Swift so I called a member of the NBRC and I was told "..he wouldn't bother submitting the sighting to the NBRC without a photo..", so since I did not have my camera with me to get a photo, I never submitted the sighting to NBRC or to eBird (until now). The mine pit wall at that location is a straight drop of over 400 feet to the pit lake which would be a possible environment for a Black Swift to hang out. White-Throated Swifts annually nest along that particularly segment of the mine pit wall.

Swift was clearly bigger than swallows, all dark, with longer tail than Chaetura swifts. "Kited" in strong wind overhead for a few seconds, then quickly flew away. Hard to judge flight style due to strong wind. Could all the rain in the Sierras have pushed this bird to the E our of its normal range? There are no confirmed records of breeding Black Swifts in NV according to the NV BBA (http://www.gbbo.org/projects_atlas.html).
