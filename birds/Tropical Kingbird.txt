I rushed over with D.Chang to meet with Justin and a few other birders who had the bird in view.  The TRKI was hanging with 6 or so WEKI. It eventually flew to the orchard where we were given great looks.  Kingbird structure with a heavier bill than surrounding Westerns, brighter yellow extending higher up into the chest and almost to throat, diagnostic notched tail without any white along edges of outer rects. I DID NOT hear it vocalize, but Justin assured me that he heard it give a TRKI song when he first observed it.

On that note, the bird never elicited a call and we have meticulously gone through the perils of separating TRKI from COKI based on phenotypic traits to separate the closely related species. We feel that the white edged coverts and flight feathers are more indicative of a juvenile Tropical over Couch's; the back color isn't as greenish as would be for COKI; and the bill seems more in line with Tropical based on length.

When I observed it I immediately noticed the amount of yellow in the upper breast and larger bill. I watched it for ~ 1.5 hours to confirm species and try and get an audio recording. There was also a CAKI and 2 WEKI in the area for direct comparison. Besides the mentioned id characteristics, others of note were the TRKI had brown not black rect coloration without any white. The tail also appeared notched when perched and in flight. The TRKI showed pale edged wing coverts that the other 2 Tyrannus species did not have. The back was greener than the other kingbirds but not as green as other TRKI I have seen in past. The Tropical was chased once by a Western and gave a short trill call in flight. I also managed to record a short trill call/half song when it was perched in the top of the a tree which will be added eventually.

A kingbird slightly larger but similar to Western Kingbird.  I noticed this bird having a distinctly larger and heavier bill, and no white, marginal tail feathers.

It was perched in top of cottonwood. From profile could see larger and longer sized bill, greenish back, and dark tail with notch that did not have any white on outer rects. I took a few pictures before it flew across wash into another cottonwood where a WEKI was perched for direct comparison. I watched it for ~10 mins before I crossed the weir and tried to relocate. I could not find it for ~10 mins and there was 3 WEKI in area. I saw it briefly near edge of wash before it flew out of view. I used playback of both TRKI and COKI to try and elicit a response to determine species confidently. The bird did not come into song of TRKI or song and call of COKI but did come into twitter call #1 of TRKI from app. It flew above me and perched in tree across wash with WEKI again. Here I saw yellow extending into upper chest.  I grabbed pictures before it flew away and downstream and out of sight. A RSHA then flew upstream dispersing all kingbirds in area. I searched for another 30 mins but could not relocate.--Although no diagnostic call/song was given during observation, the response to audio and the vagrant tendencies of Tropical makes me feel comfortable calling this TRKI over COKI.

My view was mostly obscured but I saw that it was a kingbird and that the belly was very bright yellow and the breast was green. I immediately told Martin that we needed to get a closer look at this kingbird. I changed position a little and saw the bird’s long bill. The bird then flew and we knew right away that we were dealing with a Tropical/Couch's Kingbird. Martin immediately pulled out his recordings to play a Tropical song/call. Immediately the bird started calling/singing and there was no doubt that it was a Tropical. Martin and I both began getting voice recordings and photos of the bird. The bird worked it's way north and out into the desert. I followed it way out and was trying to get ahead of it in hopes it would fly back to the rest stop. After about 30 minutes of flying, singing/calling and feeding at the tops of the Sagebrush and Rabbitbrush, it flew back to the rest stop trees. There, it perched on a dead exposed branch along the highway side of the rest stop about 15-20 up. It was relatively unconcerned with us and began preening and closing its eyes, all the while calling intermittently. It was fairly windy and the north wind actually made it a little chilly out. We stayed with the bird for right around an hour (6pm to 7pm). The long bill, green breast, bright deep yellow belly, brownish gray color to the underside of the tail feathers and the diagnostic song/calls made this tough identification easy.  I will be posting photos on my Flickr site soon and full documentation will be submitted to the NBRC.
