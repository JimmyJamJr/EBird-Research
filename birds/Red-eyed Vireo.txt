It fed slow and deliberately making only short distance movements.  This made it hard to follow and hard to observe.  I saw the bird four or five times each time seeing a little more of the plumage details and features.  Total observation time was probably about 30 seconds.  The bird had an even green back, green wings with no wing bars, a dark eye line, pale supercilium, a black boarder line to the grayish crown, whitish below with some washed yellow to the undertail coverts and a thick heavy bill.  More field notes and details will be submitted to the NBRC.

I first saw this bird fly from the orchard area to the tree in the center of the lawn in front of the main ranch house.  I was able to get Dennis and Rose on the bird and we observed the bird off and on for about 10 minutes.  I got acceptable photographs.  At one point the bird landed on the roof of the house and picked at the wooden shingles.  The bird was a classic looking Red-eyed Vireo with a dark eye line, dark boarder line to the gray crown, green back and wings, yellowish washed undertail coverts, creamy to whitish breast and belly color, thick long vireo bill, etc.  The bird was observed from 1:37 PM to 1:41 PM and again from 1:45 PM to 1:46 PM.

I was trying to get to Lyman Crossing but flash floods had messed up the road pretty good. I did get into pure desert and a ways past the last cottonwoods. The birding was very good today with last night's thunder and rain storms very evident and keeping things cooler than normal. The birds were singing all day. The ground was wet for most of the day and it was quite humid.  07:45-16:15. Cloudy off and on with thunder clouds mostly, getting sunnier as the afternoon wore on, 58-88 °F.	A surprise was the RED-EYED VIREO at Boyd Siding. It was silent but "pished" in very close so I got a good study. The gray crown contrasted with the back and the distinct white supercilium was border with a dark border both above and below. The underparts were very white with only a small flush of yellowish along the upper breast and lower flanks. I was close enough to get just a hint of red in the mostly brown appearing eye. There were no wing bars.

Apparently nesting with a Warbling Vireo.  Heard the REVI sing as soon as I arrived--caught occasional glimpses of the bird each time it brought food back to the nest, but it took about 45 minutes to get a clear view of the entire bird (it stopped in the open for about 15 seconds before delivering a spider to the nest).  Olive green back, white underparts, gray cap, a smudge of yellow near its shoulder.  Eyes were reddish brown, with a strong, long white supercillium with a thin black line below the white.  Also had a dark line going through its eye.  Will submit paperwork for review.

This bird has been seen in this location by many birders since it was first located on July 2, 2013.  Today I was lucky to see the bird with Zach Ormsby who has been following and photographing this bird since it was first seen.  Zach heard the bird call, then played a tape of the bird calling that he had made.  The bird came in and I was able to see it two times in the willows where it landed.  It was partially shaded but the sun glinted in the eye and I could see the red.  Compared to a warbling vireo it was bigger with a much bigger bill.  Pale under with a prominent white eye line.  Zach took many photographs while we were observing it.

Very "crisp" white eyebrow that contrasted with the grayish cap.  Whitish chest and belly.  Olive green back.  A possible second bird flew in at about the same time, but I never had both birds in view at the same time.  The first bird was silent the whole time.
