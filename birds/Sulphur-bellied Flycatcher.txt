Bird was briefly seen at close range perched a few meters up in a tree near edge of the cottonwood-willow grove, did not vocalize. I was setting up video monitoring equipment while conducting SWFL research and had put my camera down on a log. When I moved to walk over to grab the camera, the bird flushed and was not refound. Large flycatcher with medium-large, stout bill, streaky overall, broad dark eye and malar stripes, pale yellow on abdomen, rusty tail. Piratic Flycatcher was ruled out due to this bird having a longer bill than that species, and Streaked Flycatcher ruled out due to this bird not having quite as long or large a bill, as well as this bird having more extensive yellow wash on the abdomen than that species would have. Full written details were submitted to the NBRC.
