I also believe this was one of two that was present.  Female stayed in the bushes.  I will upload a photo if someone tells me where to upload.	I found what I believe to be a Hepatic Tanager at Fletcher View Campground, Mt. Charleston NV.  I have a photo but am unsure of how to post to this page.  I also believe this to be the male of a pair.  The female stayed fairly hidden in the bushes so I was unable to get a photo.

We were birding the north side of the road near a spring and pond when Martin called out a bird flying in towards us.  We followed it with our binoculars and it landed not too far away in a tree.  We immediately recognized it as something unusual.  I took a number of photos of the bird realizing it could be a Hepatic Tanager.  The bird then flew down to the pipe that was pouring water into a small pond.  The bird drank from the end of the pipe.  I crept over to clear the berm and was able to get some nice photos.  The bird then gave its diagnostic "chuck" call helping clinch the identification.  Some field notes:  The crown and throat and undertail coverts were brighter yellow than the breast flanks or belly, the bill was gray with a paler base especially to the lower mandible, bill culmen was slightly curved, wings did not show wing bars, legs gray, back was grayish-greenish with some brownish hints to the tertials and primaries. After drinking the bird flew up to a cottonwood and preened/straightened its wet feathers.  Then it flew out the back of the tree not to be seen again. See attached photos.
