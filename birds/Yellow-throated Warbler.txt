First found on the Moapa CBC.  We obtained very good photos as it perched in front of us after drinking from the stream.  The bird spent most of it's time in the tall palms feeding around the fruit clusters.  But it did perch oddly out in the open at the top of a dead tree for about 5 minutes.  Lores had some yellow and the chin had a thin line of white so I am not sure on subspecies yet.

Martin Meyers and myself have had a good bird in this tree before so we decided to check it.  The wind was intermittent and fairly strong when it was blowing.  I pished to check for movement.  Immediately a bird flew down.  Instantly I knew what I had.  The bird was unmistakable and diagnostic.  It was a "white-lored" Yellow-throated Warbler.  The bird moved quick and keep flying right as Martin keep putting his bino's up.  Despite seeing the bird around four times, Martin was unable to get on the bird other than seeing movement and a bird in flight.  We spent over an hour searching for the warbler but were unable to relocate it.  Martin was upset at missing such a megararity but it is hard to be too upset when the day before we had the Kite.  At least that is what I tried to tell him.
