This was an unmistakable adult Little Blue.  A summer rarity for this region, but as an east-coaster, I am very familiar with this species and am 100% certain of the identification.

The bird was flying through the trees from the largest/uppermost lake/pond to the lowermost pond.  I immediately recognized it because it was in beautiful adult plumage.  I ran down to where I saw it fly, just to see it fly back up to the largest/uppermost pond.  I relocated it in the large reed patch at the southwest end of the lake.  The bird was resting about half way up the tall cattails.  I took a bunch of pictures from across the lake and called Deb Vogt who was birding another area of the park.  Shortly after she arrived the bird flew down to the water and began walking around on the floating mat of reeds and debris and eventually was belly deep in the water.  The bird was intermittently visible as it would pass back and forth by gaps in the reed clumps.  We stayed with the bird for quite a while watching it slowly move around to feed.  The bird held its head extended out often tilting its head to see better with one eye or the other.  Then while the neck was extended it would quickly stab into the water after prey.  I posted the bird to the NV Birds list serve and sent out a few texts.  Soon five more birders arrived to enjoy the bird (Theresa Hyde, Dick and Carolyn Titus, Rita Schlageter and Joan Clarke).  The bird was clearly a small heron (significantly smaller than the nearby Great Blue Heron and significantly larger than the nearby Green Herons, it was an even slate blue on the back, wings, breast and belly, the neck and head were purple, the bill was bicolored with a blue-gray base and a black tip (almost half and half in pattern) and not exactly spike straight but ever so slightly drooped in shape, the facial skin was bluish-grey, the eye (iris) appeared yellow and the legs appeared black or possibly very dark greenish-blackish.  Total observation time was about 30-45 minutes over a three hour period.

The bird was periodically seen foraging near an opening in the reeds along the upper pond.

This bird was seen at about 9:00 AM in the same area where it had been the past two days.  I was able to see that there were some longer plumes off the back of the head and around the wings when the bird preened.  Also I saw that the leg color did appear blackish.  Eventually (at about 10:00 AM), I observed the bird at the lowermost pond standing on floating sticks and debris at the spillway that leads to the "natural area".  At this point I got some nice photos at about 20 yards away.  The bird became very active and was seen flying around this lake and the upper lake.  At one point a male Great-tailed Grackle gave chase and the Heron let out a loud protesting squawk.
