Got home and realized it looks much more like a Nuttall's than a Ladderbacked.  Was dicussed on BIrding Nevada and 2 experienced birders said it was a Nuttall's.    10 photos to be added.

This was my first time into Circle L Ranch.  I didn't know the procedure so I didn't stay long.  I quickly played a tape and the bird flew in calling loudly.  I had good looks and then left the ranch.  I wish I knew that birders were allowed to stay and bird.  This bird was originally found a few days earlier by some California birders.

When I heard it, I doubted my own ears, so I wanted to see the bird.  I found it preening high up in a tree next to the large cottonwood near the broken rock wall.  I observed the bird for a few minutes waiting for it to call again while I tried to get a look at its upper back.  The bird flew and gave its two note pidik call again.  I chased it around for a while never getting a good look at its upper back.  After I lost the bird, I went and got Dennis and Rose and asked them to get their tape.  We then went to the backside of the orchard near the workers residences and played the tape.  The bird responded instantly and flew into a neighboring tree.  I was able to get fairly good photos for documentation.  It took a while to see all the field marks, because the bird was constantly flying from tree to tree.  The few times we played the tape, it would respond actively with calls and rattles as it flew around overhead.  Over the next 45 minutes the bird would occasionally call as it worked the trees around the main residence.--
