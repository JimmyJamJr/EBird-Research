She was with a large flock of Yellow-rumped Warblers.

Warbler structure, yellow face with light olive auricular patch and top of head running into a bright green back without any streaks, white throat, no yellow extending into breast, black streaking along sides, black wings with 2 white wing bars, all white undertail with a small amount of yellow in the vent.  It also chipped once. The chip was duller than a Townsend's would be and I matched it to species using Xeno-canto almost immediately. It stayed high and did not offer any picture opportunities except for one in which I captured its butt as it took off. I cropped the picture, and some yellow can be seen in the vent, specifically above the left leg as well as showing its all white undertail.  It took off with some LEGOs and could not be refound.

I originally found the bird at a little before 9 AM and I only had a few brief looks before loosing it.  I spent about another hour and a half trying to relocate the bird without any success.  In the afternoon I returned to try and relocate it.  This time I was able to find it easily and get a number of photos.  I observed the bird the second time between 2:40pm and 2:50pm.  The yellow vent "saddle" mark was easily observed.  The bird called a number of times.  The call was like a Townsend's or Black-throated Gray Warbler.  At 5:00pm I returned to try and help Carolyn and Dick Titus get on the bird.  We had the bird a number of times but unfortunately Carolyn could never get on it.  At one point it caught a large insect and ate it on a branch.  We observed the bird off and on until dark.  Documentation including photos will be submitted to the NBRC.
