It rested most of the time offering brief looks in the scope. It showed some characteristics of a Glossy which kept me on the bird.  It wasn't until I got closer that I could see several characteristics of both GLIB and WFIB. Online research helped me feel confident in this as a hybrid. --The bird stood out from the associating White-faced Ibis in the flock by the lack of thick white lines surrounding the face and the upper part of the bill being straw colored. Eventually, the eye appeared red in the sun and was confirmed with a closer look. The white lines surrounding the face where thin and did not fully circle the back of the eye.  The exposed skin between the eye and bill was more a purplish color. Sometimes it appeared more red and sometimes it appeared more blue depending on amount of sun hitting it and angle of bird's head. The bill also appeared two toned, which is characteristic of a hybrid based on a Leukering paper, mixing characteristics of gray (WFIB) and brown (GLIB).

One of the Ibis stood out from the rest based on a combination of traits NOT including having a  very prominent red eye, reddish facial skin, or white extending behind the eye. These are features of the expected White-faced Ibis. The bird was also in adult plumage. To try and better understand this bird I threw it on an advanced i.d. forum since it wasn't a WFIB, did not seem correct for GLIB, or did not have a very prominent hybrid look to it.  The response was in favor of a hybridization of GLIB X WFIB.  Noted features to support this were based on several comments including a hint of red in the eye, light pinkish tinges to lower facial skin, broad pale streaking on head (favoring WFIB), and a not distinct border between the grayish face and upper blue skin around eye. Other comments stated that these hybrids are becoming  more and more present in the West and all Plegadis should be scrutinized carefully.

When I reviewed this record for the NBRC I gave it a more critical look as if the record wasnâ€™t my own. I then started to notes signs of hybridization. The bird had gray facial skin with an obvious thin blue border that ran from the bill to the eye.  The eye was clearly darker but still reddish.  Another sign of hybridization was the pale area behind the eye and on top of the bill. A pure Glossy would not have this. The bill also seemed less horn colored and closer to some of the nearby W-f Ibis bills. Observed the bird from 4:45-5:02pm.  I showed the bird to Rowan.  We were rather close to the bird which gave great looks and opportunity to study.  It preened or just rested relatively still the whole time we observed it.  Photos will be added when I put together my submission to the NBRC.
