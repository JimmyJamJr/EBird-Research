One of the first birds we saw, but very high in the canopy.  About 90 minutes later I had a brief view of it closer.  First saw white outer tail feathers on dark tail and white wing bars on dark wings.  Belly and undertail coverts were white, some dark streaks on flanks.  Later got a view of the head and neck which were a deep, rich yellow (may have been an orange tint, but due to late afternoon sun and sunlight filtered through smoke I can't be sure).  Triangular gray face patch, broad yellow supercillium.

This bird had a yellow face (with a triangular dark patch on the cheek) and breast with dark streaks on the flank. The shade of yellow was a more orange type, almost orange-yellow in some light, and was not the lemon yellow of a Townsend's/Hermit. The face came off as a yellow eyeline with a black one beneath it on the lores and upper cheek. There was a thick broken eye ring going into the eyeline above and broken by the lores and in the back. It struck me as too long (actually a characteristic mentioned on All About Birds lol) for TOWA, which look rather compact, and with the wrong bill shape. Definitely had two bright white wing bars on a black wing, white vent, black legs with some orange on the feet. Tail was dark with white on the inner feathers from below, which in flight was revealed to be an extensive white outer tail, with two all white outer feathers. The back was dark grey and though it was often hard to see the back well, I saw that it was at least faintly streaked in black, if not more. In flight there appeared to be a white stripe by the wing, but this was tricky to see as I mostly saw the bird from below. I think a combination of the structure, the tail pattern, the back pattern and the fact that there was nothing wrong with the face pattern clinches this as a Blackburnian. The bird was in a mixed flock with BTYW, WIWA, TOWA, NAWA, and OCWA, moving constantly. I got some good views through my binoculars and I watched it for a good twenty minutes and saw it from many angles (though at times it would vanish for a few minutes), but it was very tricky to photograph. I got some photos where you can see the structure well plus the overall coloration from below and face pattern, plus a blurry picture in flight that shows the tail pattern and appears to show the white stripe on the back. I did not get any good photos of the back though. Would be first county record if accepted.----Update: I texted Logan about this bird, who pointed out that the yellow wrapping around under the auriculars also eliminates Townsend's. He also mentioned also that the the small size which I noted but did not write down in my first notes is useful for eliminating some eastern species.

At Lida Pond we found a BLACKBURNIAN WARBLER feeding actively in the tree over the pond.  We found the bird at about 4:00pm.  Both Dennis and I took over 200 pictures each.  The bird was very cooperative providing great looks.   The bird appeared to be a bright first fall male.  The back braces were quite obvious and the throat and breast were bright yellow with a slight wash of orange.  The bird only called a few times as it fed.  What a spectacular bird.  I managed to get some great pictures.----

Don Molde also got good looks at the bird and I had a few brief disappointing views of various parts of the bird as it moved through the trees.  The bird disappeared relatively quickly and we were unable to get photos.  We searched for the bird another 2 hours without any luck.

Very bright bird.  I found this bird in the trees just south of the dike where the trees rejoin the edge of the road.  Observed from 11 AM to 11:20 AM.   It was quite active and would fly from tree to tree pursuing insects.  It often came in very close allowing for great photo oportunities.  Photos and notes will be submitted to the NBRC.

Only reporting notable birds due to time constraints.	Seen extremely well, although only briefly (8-10 seconds). Unobstructed views at eye level no more than 8m away. Full report will be sent to the Nevada Bird Records Committee. A fairly bright-faced adult female. First noticed orangish yellow face and throat that continued onto the upper breast. Orange/yellow on face was broken by a dark auricular patch. Top of head dark, same color as auricular patch, finer details not assessed. Wings were dark/black with two very obvious white wing bars. Dark streaking limited to flanks and was rather thin. Belly and undertail coverts white. By the time I had assessed these details, the bird was gone. I did not get to assess the back, only noticed that it did not contrast with the wings or the rest of the upper body of the bird (wasn't green like a Townsend's or Black-throated Green). ----I was in the middle of a point count and could not stop to chase the bird. I did attempt to get my camera out, but I could not refind the bird post-survey. This bird appeared to be moving up canyon fairly quickly. I'm extremely familiar with this bird in the east where I see them every spring and fall.
