I was suspicious of this and followed it for roughly ~45 minutes taking pictures of it and studying it.  It seemed very lethargic at times.  I had a suspicion it might have been an Alder based on several i.d. characteristics. I used playback of both ALFL and WIFL but the bird did not emit a response. In a private conversation with a regarded birder, he also suggested the possibily of Alder based on a bird he recently observed with similar behavior and traits including thin weak eye ring, buffy wing bars, large bill with complete orange lower mandible.

I think this bird is a good candidate for Alder.  Most notable feature that points to Alder is the thin complete eyering.  Green back and apparent shortish thick bill are also better for Alder, according to some authorities.  Bird never perched higher than 6 feet off the ground, preferring to stay low over the lawn.
