Early this morning Dorothy Crowe and I observed the bird at Cottonwood Cove marina. The bird was resting on a tall buoy to the north of the floating tire harbor barrier. The bird flew into the swimming beach area and tried to land on another buoy but ungracefully fell down into the water. Not sure if it was just clumsy like Boobies are, or if it was just distracted or possibly weak?  The bird seemed to fly well so I don't think it was ill or weak.  The bird then bathed briefly (~2 minutes) and then flew out of the bay heading south.  A couple gulls pursued the bird as it rounded the house boats and out of sight.  Dorothy first saw the bird at a little before 6am and it left at around 7am.  Total observation time for me was approximately 5 minutes.  It did not return before I left at 8:45 am.  Theresa Hyde showed up a little too late to see the bird before it left. Hopefully it just went out fishing and will return to rest here at the marina later.  I got some decent photos of the bird despite the early morning light.  The bird was clearly an immature with some white feathering coming in on the light brown body.  The typical Sulid bill was long and gray to pale depending on the light with blue-gray facial skin around the eye, the feet were pale to fleshy colored, the head, neck and upper breast were an even dark brown with a strong horizontal demarcation across the breast easily distinguishable from the mottled belly.  The under wing coverts were white in some areas and mottled white and dark brown in others.  The upperside of the bird was an even dark brown.  In flight the bird's tail was long and the bird flew with it's head and neck extended.  On the left wing, the outermost primary (P10) was broken in half.  I would be interested in knowing if this could be the Lake Havasu bird.  If anyone has pictures of that bird from the past week, I would be interested in comparing that feature.  Subsequent note:  I received a photo from David Vander Pluym showing that broken primary on the Havasu bird.  Also, a birder reported seeing the bird flying up river near Fort Mojave/Bullhead City on the 16th at about 9:00 AM.  So when Jeanne found the bird it had just recently arrived.  So indeed they are the same bird.
