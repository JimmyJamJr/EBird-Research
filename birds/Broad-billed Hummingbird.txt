I first noticed the thin white eyebrow that started above the eye and blended away behind the slightly darker gray auricular patch.  I then noticed that the bill was shorter than the Black-chins zipping around the area and nearly as short as the Anna's also present.  The bill was curved enough that it was noticeably different from the other hummingbirds present.  I then saw the red lower mandible as my view of the bird was from about a 45 degree angle out and below.  My distance from the bird was probably less than 30 feet so it showed well in my binoculars.  The bird was not in the sun at the time so the red bill being an artifact of light seems unlikely.  At this point I knew I had a female Broad-billed.  I raised my camera and as expected, the bird raced off out of sight.  I waited for the bird to return and had brief views of it again as it moved around some flowers along the trail.  I the heard it calling around a mesquite up behind me but I was not able to get on it.  The call was typical for this species and was reminiscent of a Ruby-crowned Kinglet call.  The hummingbird had an iridescent green back, grayish front (not clean white like Black-chin and not as messy or smudgy as Anna's), was of average hummer size (not large like Magnificent and not small like Calliope) but seemed shorter than the more stretched out or sleeker looking Black-chins, and the bird had a darker gray auricular patch that extended though the eye onto the lores of the bird.   I really didn't get anything else on the bird before it was gone.  Photo attempts were unsuccessful.  I stayed in the area for another 45 minutes.  The nearby hummingbird feeder was refilled while I was there and the Black-chinned and Anna's hummingbirds were in and out of that pretty regularly but I did not see the bird visit the feeder while I was watching for it.  Hopefully it will be relocated and photographed by other birders.
