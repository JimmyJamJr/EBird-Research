I sent the photos to Jon Dunn who confirmed by suspicions.  The yellow below the black throat and the greenish back are inconsistent with "pure" Hermit.  This bird is probably a backcross with Hermit.

Whole face yellow with weak auricular pattern. The only point suggesting Townsendâ€™s is the bright yellow wash on the underparts

Strikes against Bt Green: seems to completely lack yellow wash across vent; has a diffusely-streaked, dull-olive back/mantle; has narrow, weak flank streaks. Hermit/Townsend's characters: weak version of Townsend's facemask that also appears to have the yellow, eye-ringed look of Hermit, slight, yellow wash on breast.

On review appears to be a hybrid, so take a bow Nick Rosen for calling it correctly and our apologies for doubting that call
