Also I didn't realize that HEWA and TOWA hybridize so I probably should have sprinted to get my camera, so someone better than me could confirm this. I'll keep my eyes and ears and camera ready this afternoon to gather more evidence if possible.----changing observation to this because I'm insecure about this sighting. Please refer to recording below
