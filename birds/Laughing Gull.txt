I thought it looked different even at that long distance, but when I hiked down to the beach, it had flown to the north.  The Identity of this bird plagued me and the fealing that it could have been a Laughing Gull was nagging.  So I returned to Walker Lake this afternoon (9-8-04) and found the gull again.  It was feeding in the water close to shore.  There is a raft of vegetation in the water and the bird was feeding in this area.  It ranged from here to 400 yards north towards the delta.  It mainly hangs out on shore, walking back and forth.  It is apparently an adult Laughing Gull in almost complete basic plumage.  I took over 60 pictures of it in flight, in the water and on the shore.  I was able to get very close to it and should have frame filler pictures in very good light.  It is not overly shy, but if it is near other gulls and they fly, it will also fly.   Typically, when it flies it goes a long way, but it never leaves the shoreline.  But it's most reliable near the bottom of the fence line.  It returns to this area even when it flies away for a period of time.  The only person I could get a hold of that was willing to jump in his vehicle was Jack Walters.  He headed down and we watched and photoed the bird at close range for over an hour.  I had a total viewing time of 3 hours on this bird from 3:00pm to 6:15pm.

With my binos I noticed a bird on shore that was obviously different from the other gulls.  In my scope I studied the bird at great distance and in failing light, (not too bad but the sun was behind the mountains behind me).  The bird was smaller than Ring-bills but not by a lot.  The bill was long and appeared slightly drooped.  The bill was black. It appeared that the bill was longer than the length of the head and was long enough to catch my attention as possibly different than our norm.    The bird appeared to be wearing black ear muffs.  The dark patches behind the eye wrapped around the back of the head to the other ear patch.  It was more diffuse in the back and not nearly as dark.  I am not familiar with the amount of black on the head in early September of the medium sized hooded gulls.  The bird was obviously a medium sized gull due to the direct comparison with ring-bills.  The wings appeared long, but how long was hard to determine.  If there was white tips in the primaries they were very small because I could not discern any.  The neck was lightly washed with gray and the sides of the neck onto the breast were very lightly washed with gray.  The bird was dark mantled, much grayer than the nearby ring-bills.  The legs appeared long, in fact when I saw it through binos at great distance, I though the bird may be a shorebird.  When the gull walked by the ring-bills it was nearly as tall and almost as long.  The legs were dark possibly even black.  In the scope (Leica at 60X) the birds was about 3/4 frame in size, so I saw it well, but at that power and in the failing light, some of the finer details were "smoothed" out.  When the bird took a short flight, I did not see any black in the tail, but I can not say that there wasn't any faded black or gray in the tail.  But from what I saw, the tailed appeared white.  The main problem with making a positive ID was that I was unable to note the underwing pattern.  -- --As I ran down the mountain of sand from the highway down to the shoreline, the bird flew way in towards the delta.  It flew long before I was in range to see it or photograph it.  In fact I left my girlfriend with my scope at the road to direct me to the bird.  When I got to were the bird was supposed to be it wasn't there.  I looked back at my girlfriend through my binos and she was giving me the sign that the bird flew well North.  It was well out of range to get to before it would be dark.  So I made the long trek back up the slope.  -- --So, is the bird a Franklin's Gull or a Laughing Gull?  Most of the field marks I noted suggest Laughing Gull.  Long dark slightly drooped looking bill, long dark legs, head and neck coloration, larger size, lack of white primary tips, etc.  But I am not familiar with how much black is shown on the head of Laughing gull in early September.  The black was dark behind the eye but is that because the bird was not fully into basic plumage yet?  The black was by no means a partial hood or half helmet look.  It was more like ear muffs.  If I could have noted the underwing pattern I could safely eliminate one or the other species.  If the underwing pattern is right for laughing it would either be a 2nd basic or adult basic.  The coloration of the neck was between 2nd basic and adult basic and the tail didn't show any black thus it was closer to adult basic.  Most importantly, Franklin's is not a rarity.  It is obviously the much more expected bird.----I returned on the 8th, relocated the bird and concluded it was indeed a Laughing Gull.  Many Photos taken and subsequently accepted by the NBRC.
