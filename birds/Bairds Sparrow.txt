We found the bird at about 7:30 AM and stayed with it until a little after 8:00 AM.  The bird was seen in the tall un-mowed grass (~10 inches deep) at the Northeast corner of the park.  The bird's behavior immediately caught our attention.  It reminded us of the LeConte's Sparrow we had at Miller's back in 2000.  The bird moved/crept through the grass like a mouse often coming to within five to six feet of us.  After eliminating common species we arrived at the Ammodramus Sparrows.  Knowing how rare these birds are in Nevada we wanted to make sure we got very good photos and noted all the important field marks.  Some of the most important features we noted about the bird that got us rather excited was the obvious orangish crown stripe, dark lateral throat stripe, narrow streaked necklace, large bill, flat head, two black spots on the side of the face, off-white eyering, thin tail, bright scaly patterned back with white feather edges giving the look of braces, and rufous coloring on the tertials and scapulars (see photos at the link below).  After consulting reference books and making phone notifications to other Nevada birders we went back to relocate the bird.  Despite more than an hour of searching we could not relocate the bird.  We checked again this afternoon without success and we will try one more time in the morning before heading east.  Subsequently accepted by the NBRC for a Nevada first.
