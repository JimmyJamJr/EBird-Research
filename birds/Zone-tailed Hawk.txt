Emphasize particularly the marks used to identify the bird, but include a complete description of the bird.  Include size, overall shape, plumage and color pattern; details on shape or size of bill, wings, and tail.  Describe what you are actually observing in the field.]--The bird was a fairly large raptor with fairly rectangular, parallel edged wings and a long tail.  Overall the plumage was black on the body, underwing coverts, and tail.  The flight feathers were silvery gray, underneath.  At first glance the bird was quickly dimissed as a Turkey Vulture to which it closely resembled in size, shape, and plumage.  When I put my binoculars on it a single bold solid white subterminal band was clearly visible on the underside of the otherwise black tail.  ------[Describe the bird's overall behavior:]--The bird came gliding across the sky from the direction of the crest of the Spring Mts./Bonanza Peak area.  If glided quickly and directly on a very slight dihedral.  Within 15 seconds or so it disappeared behind a ridge to the northwest.----[Describe the habitat in which you observed the bird:]--Area is dominated by farily dry Pinon-Juniper woodland with contiguous stands of mature Ponderosa and a few White Firs following the more mesic drainage bottoms.  Because the bird was gliding high over a broad area I can comment of specific micro-habitat.  The sighting occurred very near a fairly wet spring with a particularly mesic ponderosa canyon directly above.  The area below the crest, from which the bird may have came, is dominated by Ponderosa, White Fir, and possibly a few Bristlecones (as IDed at great length through binoculars).--------[Describe the bird's calls or sounds, if heard, including method of delivery, i.e., from perch, in flight, etc.:]  None given--------[List similar species and how you eliminated them:]--As stated, my initial impression was of a Turkey Vulture.  Upon closer inspection this was easily eliminated based on the solid white subterminal band on the underside of the tail.  The fast direct flight and shallow dihedral were also somewhat characteristic of a TV.  Common Black-hawk was easily eliminated based on the long tail, relatively narrow and straight wings, black tail tip, and distinctly two-toned underwings.  The flight feathers were too dark and the tail pattern all wrong for a dark rough-legged.  The bold single white tail band was inconsistent with any type of Red-tailed hawk including Harlan's.  The flight feathers were also too dark gray/silver and the wing shape wrong (too straight)------[Prior experience with this and similar species:]--I have extensive experience with Zone-tailed Hawk from New Mexico, Arizona, and once Texas.  I've lived for four years in southern NM where I focused much birding effort on the southwestern mountains where the species borders on common.  I have seen it many times in the Chiricahuas and other ranges of SE Arizona as well.  I am also very experienced with Turkey Vulture.----[Optical equipment:]--Swift Eaglet 10X42 roof prism binoculars----

Tail showed one darker terminal band and mostly light colored otherwise, probably indicative of a juvenile bird.

White tail band, narrow barring on underwings, and slightly different flight pattern distinguished this bird from a TUVU. The prominent tail band also indicates the bird was an adult. The bird flew directly over head a couple of times at about 30m high, dove and captured a lizard (possibly a whiptail) then perched 75m away in a Joshua Tree. After about 1 minute of perch time and being mobbed by a male AMKE the bird took off and soared northward, gaining lots of elevation.

A raven was eating something in the field close by, but went after the hawk right away.  At first I thought it was a Turkey Vulture as I saw silvery wing linings, but quickly saw the banded tail.  I considered Common Black Hawk, but the wings were long and slim, same with the tail.  The chase continued for a bit, but in a few minutes the raptor returned alone and went to roost in the willows, same location where it originally flushed.  Bad photos taken with little detail (just a hint of paler wing linings on one and another with a bit of banded tail) - attached.  I was able to find the bird the next morning at roost; a separate submission will be made for that date with additional photographs.

(Later we saw the Mississippi Kite in the closed area, with the vultures.) The refuge manager kindly suggested that we van-camp in a closed area at the back of the refuge, which was much appreciated.	Classic Zone-tail: very dark, with multiple tail bands, yellow legs and cere, and a more slender structure than a Common Black-Hawk. The refuge manager said that the day before someone had reported a Common Black-Hawk, but that was a misidentification, if this was the same bird, as seems likely.

Bird was solid black with yellow feet and yellow bill. When flying, it strongly resembled a turkey vulture with wings held in shallow v-shape. It was distinguished from a common black-hawk by the overall shape, as well as the silvery flight feathers, which contrasted with the body (further reminiscent of turkey vulture), and the tail pattern, which was subtly and finely barred with thin black and charcoal gray stripes (leading to the determination of juvenile plumage). While the feet were bright yellow, the legs did not appear as long as those of common black-hawk.
