Calls were a better fit for WWCR based on my experience in the East, where doubtless different RECR subspecies dominate.  Nonetheless, at least 2 birds showed definite white bars on wings, a rare enough trait for RECR that finding two together seems phenomenally unlikely.  Since I wasn't aware of the gravity of the ID at the time and since I am inexperienced with this region I will not specify to species.  Definite RECR reported on this checklist were an entirely separate flock.

I know it's all good western stuff but no joke it's actually what we saw.
