It wasn't brighter at the front like in the Cassin's finch.  There was a red "wash" over the back of the finch as well. Bill was not as long and pointed as the Cassin's bill. Deeply notched tail. No white eye arcs. Female present as well. Did not get a picture of the female, but did see that she had a rather distinct white eye brow (where the male is pink/red) and I specifically looked at and was able to determine that there was no streaking on the undertail coverts - they were plain white.

Matched recordings of birds on Xeno-canto from Quebec.  Photographed and audio recorded.  Bird was seen at the top of a tree in bare branches near the coyote statue.  The bird didn't appear greenish but it was in direct sunlight and I couldn't really see the back due to viewing from mostly below.  Based on what i could see, the bird may be an eastern form based on overall brownish coloration and the song (if truly different than western).  Photos will be added later this week.

Two came in much closer while I pished and gave the diagnostic ‘pik’ call of a Purple Finch several times. I hear this call regularly around Portland Oregon where I live. Having lived in Utah for 20 years, I’m also very familiar with CAFI ‘keeup’ calls that they give regularly and none were heard at any point these birds were in the area. These birds were more olive green above than CAFI with relatively broad smudgy streaks on the underside. However, the undertail coverts appeared clean white with no sign of any streaking. I couldn’t say absolutely there was no streaking, but given the distance and views, I felt would have seen the streaks if they were there based on Cassin’s Finches I have seen in the past. They also lacked the thin white eye ring exhibited by CAFI.  My phone recorder unfortunately crapped out, but I managed a few blurry digibinoc photos.

Contrary to those distinctive calls, the streaking on the breast was, to me, more suggestive of Cassin's Finch as they looked narrow and "crisp"; not what I'm used to for Purple Finches. I was on the fence about what to call it, and unfortunately I got no further views of the bird that day. Luckily, the bird was still here the next day and I was able to get much better photos (see 9/19 checklist), and was able to confirm the ID with other birders.

I was talking to Martin on the phone and he reminded me that I should probably try playing a recording of Purple Finch songs and calls.  So I took out my iPod and played it in the area where the bird had been seen yesterday by Meg Andrews.  To my surprise the PURPLE FINCH popped up out of nowhere and flew right at me.  It landed in a nearby bare tree and began calling.  I got a lot of great photos and I also recorded the bird calling on video.  I stayed with the bird for about 15 minutes (10:45AM to 11:00AM).  The bird was feeding in the tall weedy area at the North end of the Willows.  I spoke to Dennis Ghiglieri and Rose Strickland and they said they were going to head out.  As I waited for them to arrive, the bird began calling again and I watched it for another 5-10 minutes.  I heard a car approaching on the access road and I knew it was going to be Dennis and Rose.  As they were driving in, the bird took off and flew straight away to the west.  Oh No!  I couldn¿t believe it.  I just lost sight of it as they pulled up.  Talk about a bad break.  We hung around and talked for about 10-15 minutes before I decided to play the ¿tape¿ again.  As before, I got an immediate response.  A bird began calling and approached from the willows.  The first bird was clearly a dark greenish brownish bird typical of the Western subspecies.  This second bird appeared less dark overall and less greenish toned and was more brownish.  It was calling like the other Purple and at one point even sang back in response to the tape.  The bird appeared to be different from the first one, which I had watched disappear to the west minutes earlier.  So it appears that there is probably two separate birds feeding in this area.  Not sure how I couldn't find one the first two hours I was there.

One male and three female-types. I had to run back to my car to get my camera. Recorded their unique 'pip' calls and took many photos. They eventually flew farther back and I didn't encounter then again on my walk. ID: 'pip' call is distinctive and heard from several birds as they were feeding and especially when the group of them flew back farther in the yard. From HOFI by strongly contrasting face pattern. From CAFI by lack of eye ring and curved culmen; streaks much less well defined. From Eastern PUFI by narrower pale areas on face and, on male, duller overall colors and brownish sides of breast.

Good look at the head. Overall maroon or wine red color on the entire head, the neck matched the color of the throat, with a darker shaded band behind the eye. My wife saw it first, and had a few more seconds to look at it. We had excellent light. We had just been looking at an adult male Cassin's finch, and all we had to do was turn to get an equally good view of this bird. Contrast was obvious, with this bird appearing to have a more chubby build overall and a much deeper red color overall on the head.----Unfortunately it flew after I had only a few seconds to look at it, and before I could get my camera on it. We tried to follow it. It had flown east along the trail and it's destination was hidden from our sight by a tree. I played my iBird pro call for the Purple finch to get the sound of it's possible song in my ears. From the direction that it had flown, I heard a finch song that sounded to me very similar to the iBird “Purple Finch 3 - Typical song - CA”, and tried to locate the bird that was making that song. However I was not successful in locating that bird, and it was moving north away from the trail, so we gave up after about 10 minutes. ----The location was practically at the farthest point on our loop from the trailhead - about 3.7 miles whether you go counterclockwise (as we did) or clockwise. To find the site going counterclockwise, shortly beyond the trailhead go right along the shorter route towards Mt. Rose. After 3.2 miles you pass the waterfall, and continue towards Mt. Rose. At the waterhall, continue north on the west side of a meadow for another 0.2 miles towards Mt. Rose, until the trail junction where a left turn goes towards Relay Peak. There is a sign there, and I'm not sure what it says, but it is the first and only junction around. Take that left turn. The trail climbs steeply for about 0.15 miles (gain of ~150 ft), and then levels off for the next 0.15 miles as you walk along another meadow on your left. We saw the finch in the first trees on the left at the end of this second meadow. Google Earth puts the point at 39.327074° N, -119.929704° W, Elevation 9200 feet.

The birds are probably part of the same group that was reported late November last year.  I found the birds feeding in an ornamental tree that has fruit that looked like small cherries or mini crab apples (sorry I can’t identify winter “plumaged” deciduous trees).  The tree is in the front yard of 280 Lakeview Drive which is right next to the road.  I got some very nice pictures of the birds as they fed.  I also video recorded the birds calling.  There may have been a sixth bird, but I can’t be sure.  One bird flew to a neighboring yard and then two left in the same direction and then another also left in that direction.  One remained feeding on the berries and then another flew in to the tree from a different direction.  I guess one of the four that had left could have doubled back but it could have also been a new bird.  All birds appeared to be of the western race and showed a greenish wash to the back.  Later reports indicate as many as 14 birds are in this group.

Still, I had at least 6 confirmed (plus 2 very probable) female-type birds, one adult male (plus a second adult male that was probably a Purple but I couldn't quite rule out Cassin's; I think Alan may have photos), and a separate smaller group flew in at one point included at least one additional calling Purple Finch (not seen). So 8-11 Purples, which I'll conservatively report here as 8.  ----The six to eight female types all showed the greenish hue on the upper parts, blurring and less dense streaking on the underparts compared to nearby female Cassin's Finches.  At least one male (seen and heard calling) and 2 female Cassin's were in the same flock. Male lacked eye ring, with no red concentrated on the forecrown, and only faint streaking on the underparts.

One female-type bird flew in to the top of a bare tree with about 7 House Finches.  Two HOFI were --feeding in a crabapple tree next to a cherry.  Had a very brief, but clear view of the PUFI, including off-white supercilium and off-white malar streak setting off the light brown auricular patch.  Streaking on the breast was fairly wide, but slightly diffuse; more so as it bled onto the belly.  Basic colors were light tannish brown and off-white.  A heavy gust of wind came through and all birds scattered and disappeared up and over the small hill to the east.  I was not able to tell if the 2nd PUFI was with this group of birds.--I lived for 34 years in Coastal California, where resident, coastal Purple Finches bred on our block and were in the yard almost daily.

Very fun to have seen the two birds at Rancho on Saturday, the Carson City bird yesterday, and this bird today.

Most of time spent looking at the Purple Finches.	Description applies to both birds seen except where noted: Roughly size and shape of House Finch, but stockier looking, with larger head and shorter tail. Red on head, upper breast, rump, and, on at least one bird, with a wash of red on back and wing coverts. (I assume both birds had the red wash on back and wings, but did not check this for certain on both birds.) Back with brown streaks. Strong face pattern, including dark cheek patch and obvious red eyebrow stripe that curves down at back of head. Smudgy brownish streaking on flanks. The red on the upper breast merges into some brownish smudges below. Belly whitish. On at least one bird, the undertail coverts had no obvious dark streaks. (That may have been true of other bird as well, but did not check.) Bill deeper than on a Cassin's Finch. Ground color of head more uniformly red than on a Cassin's, with the crown not standing out in color from the rest of the head. At least one of the birds sometimes had the feathers on the front of the crown partially standing up. Distinguished from House Finch by relatively larger head and shorter tail, strong face pattern, smudgy flank streaks, wash of red on back and wings, and unmarked undertail coverts. Distinguished from Cassin's Finch by more extensive red color (e.g. on whole head and on back and wings), deeper bill, smudgy flank streaks, and unmarked undertail coverts.----The two birds were in a fruiting tree just N of the easternmost building in the arboretum area. They were feeding on fruits the size of small cherries. (Not sure if they were cherries or some other rose-family fruits.)

An adult male (not the most colorful individual) and a female-type bird were together feeding in a curl-leaf mountain mahogany at the west end of the native plant garden south of the main May Museum building. The male was giving quiet contact calls (which was how I find them) and the two stuck together for the 10-15 minutes I was watching them. They eventually dropped down into a Desert Peach bush and then onto the ground (maybe to pick up some grit?) where I had excellent views from about 3-4 meters away.  The female-type bird had clean white undertail coverts and a lot of fine streaking in the supercillium and the pale malar area, with diffuse broad streaks below -- pretty typical looking "Western" Purple Finch. The male, although not the most red individual I've ever seen, only had some faint sparse (and very diffuse) streaking on the rear flanks, but the breast was basically clean. Wine red on all the upper parts and head, with a slightly curved culmen (not as curved as House Finch, but not straight like Cassins). I didn't have a camera with me (and had left my phone at home!) so no photos, but definitely one of the better opportunities I've had to stare at plumage details on this species. Eventually, a bunny and two jays flew through, and flushed them deeper into the native garden area.

I was recording a Yellow-rumped Warbler in bushes in the ditch and noticed a streaky larger bird near it. At first I figured it was a Song Sparrow, since I had just seen one, but looking closer it was clearly a female-type finch. It was alone. It flew up into a tree right above me and I looked with my binoculars, and my first impression was - oh, that's a Purple Finch, but it took my brain a second to process why. Clearly too chunky and short-tailed for a House Finch, larger bill and defined face pattern confirmed that. The well-defined eyeline and malar strip also suggested Purple over Cassin's. The streaking on the underparts was wide and fuzzy as opposed to the thinner well-defined streaks on a Cassin's Finch; moreover, the undertail coverts were a creamy white with no streaking as a Cassin's should have. The overall color was more of a warm brown as opposed to the gray-brown I associate with Cassin's Finches. The tail was deeply forked and the culmen was slightly more curved than some Cassin's Finches I have seen...I don't know if these last two observations are documented, but I've noticed a difference in my own observations. I was able to watch it for about 30-40 seconds before it flew off in the direction of the river. Since I was recording when I saw it and it was present for less than a minute, I couldn't get a picture. Though I didn't see it for a terribly long time, I had close nearly unobstructed views. I'm not sure if it will be accepted with only a sight record by one individual, but I am convinced that it was a Purple Finch. I hope to refind it tomorrow. The sun had just set when I first saw it, and I walked back and forth through the trees with berries three times, not being able to find it (or any finches at all) until it was nearly dark. Taking the trail to the left along the houses, it was seen right where the trail splits in two directions, one going to the river and one going to the Mexican Ditch, in the tallest tree right behind the blue bench.

The best photo ever submitted to eBird, no doubt
