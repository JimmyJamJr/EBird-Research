I hear reports from Paul Lehman mainly occasionally in late winter early spring.  I live in Tucson and am very familar with all of the Thrashers.  I identified this one by it''s "Whit-wheet" call.  Very distinctive.  Also got a good look at the bird 5 meters away in good light.  --The spotted sandpiper I did not know to be rare here.  There are wintering birds every year in tucson.  I saw this bird in winter plumage, tail bobbing, walking the shoreline.  Observed the bird when it flew.  They tend to drop their wings and have an odd sort of flight, shallow wingbeats.

We wandered around for a while before we heard one singing from the top of a Joshua Tree at the corner of Lincoln St. and E. Cottonwood Cove Rd.  We photographed and video recorded the bird as it sang.  The bird flew down and to the north appearing to go into a hedge near a trailer.  We walked over that way and heard a Curve-billed singing quite a bit further to the north.  I was surprised that the bird flew that far without me seeing it because I was sure it went down into a nearby hedge.  So we went after the singing bird and got more photos and video of it.  At this point I noticed and remarked that the bill was deformed which I hadn’t noticed minutes earlier on the bird at the other location.  It wasn’t until later when I was going through the photos that I realized the birds were indeed different.  The first bird was cleaner and had a normal bill while the second bird was completely worn and disheveled (especially obvious in the flanks) and had a bill deformity that prevented the tip from closing together.  These details are obvious in my photos.  Below are some differences about the two birds.----First bird (1):---bill normal with no deformity or missing piece to the bill.  Bill appeared slightly thicker and shorter than the second bird’s---flank feathers in place and undamaged---tail feathers shorter and more heavily worn/damaged with at least one stripped to the rachis.  This obvious damaged feather does not show up on any of my photos of the second bird.----Second bird (2):---bill deformity prevented complete closing at the tip.  It was hard to tell if the upper mandible was slightly twisted to the bird’s right side or if the lower mandible was angled to the bird’s left side, or if it was a combination of both.  I have a few close up photos to show the deformity.  Also, this bird’s lower mandible on the left side is broken at the tip and missing a piece (the first bird’s bill was intact in all the photos).---fleshy skin bump at end of gape on right side (not present on first bird)---long disheveled and damaged feathers along the flanks----The second bird ranged around the neighborhood as it sang from four different treetop locations.  It ranged from essentially the city park north to Waterspout all the while staying between N Nevada St. and N. Lincoln St.  The first bird was never seen again (possibly gone to tend a nest in the hedge?).----Both birds were clearly Curve-billed Thrashers based on the songs and the plumage details.  The remaining tail spots that were visible on the second bird were gray and the birds lacked real wing bars (more reliable on the first bird whose wing was in good shape).----We observed or could hear the birds singing for about an hour with our last time hearing the bird being at about 9:10 AM.

The call was identical to iBird's whit-weet call and identical to birds I've heard countless times in the Tucson area. The bird stayed in the brush for five minutes before perching up on a yucca at the base of a hill northwest of the intersection of Lincoln and Waterspout. It stayed perched in the Mojave yucca for approximately ten minutes before flying up to a large cottonwood in the next property to the north. The bird was overall light brown with a slightly darker tail, a dark long decurved bill (particularly curved at the tip), an orange iris, and no recognizable spotting or wing bars. As I was watching this bird, I clearly heard a second bird producing the same whit-weet calls from the east (opposite direction from the bird I was watching). The bird I was watching was very clearly not calling when I heard these calls. While the first bird was still perched in the cottonwood, I got out of my truck and walked east on waterspout. As I approached I could clearly hear the second bird calling from a dense patch of creosote and acacia on the north side of waterspout, half way between Lincoln and Nevada, but I could not locate this bird visually. At times, it sounded as if there could have been two birds calling from this vegetation, but I think this was just the bird moving it's head in different directions every few calls. Unfortunately I never saw the two birds together, but am absolutely positive there are at least two birds in the area.
