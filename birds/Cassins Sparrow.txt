One or two high, thin introductory notes, followed by a slowing trill, and ending with a couple slurred notes. From a distance, a plain sparrow with red behind eye that extended into auricular. Closer views showed a red streaked crown, yellow supraloral spot, thin malar line, and neatly patterned back and uppertail coverts. Singing spontaneously all morning from grassy habitat in Joshua tree forest.

Singing and acting territorial, though no indication of second bird. Song heard as I rolled up: a quick and high trill followed by a high and abrupt “deet-doo-doo-deet-doo-doo”. The song has a melancholic quality to me. The bird itself was a bit nondescript: long-tailed and big headed, gray and unstreaked below with some faint warm brown markings to crown and back. Weak wing bars. Slight eye ring and some yellow on lores. Stayed low in grass when I spooked it from Joshua Tree where it was singing. I didn’t attempt to get good photos as I wanted to leave the bird be and Justin got great ones earlier.

I found the first state record for NV of Cassin''s Sparrow. 	First state record found by me. Accepted by the NBRC -- see 2010 report: CASSIN'S SPARROW Peucaea cassinii, Shawneen Finnegan, Martin Meyers, Brian Daniels, Michael Patten, 2010-043, 6/0/0; 5/28/1989, Dyer (Esmeralda) Total NBRC endorsed records for Cassin's Sparrow: 2.--Another pre-committee record. For many years, a number of California birders traveled--to Death Valley for Memorial Day weekend, most of them passing through Dyer and--Lida on their travels. Many great Nevada records were found by this nomadic band of--birders. (I was lucky enough to be with some of them the day Finnegan caught the song--of this Cassin¿s Sparrow from very far out in an agricultural field in Dyer.)--www.gbbo.org/nbrc/GBB_2010_Report.pdf

We learned today that the Circle L Ranch was now off-limits to birders. Our sole highlight was a singing Cassin's Sparrow found by Shawneen Finnegan "less than one mile south of Dyer" near what my notes called the Double Bar 9 Ranch.	Singing and skylarking in an alfalfa field. Distant ("poor") views thru scope.

Also, see list of (~25, very roughly) observers that were also up here this Memorial Day weekend at the nearby Oasis Ranch (Mono Co., CA), on same date (5/28/1989). Also on this date, we birded Cottonwood Canyon (where we'd camped the previous night, on border of Inyo and Mono counties, CA), Oasis Ranch, and after the Circle L ranch in Dyer Nevada, we went on to Lida, Nevada, and then south to Scotty's Castle, Mesquite Springs and Furnace Creek Ranch in Death Valley National Monument. The following is based on my notes foe this date and location. --Weather:  Cool and clear (low around 50F). Habitat: Tall cottonwoods and Black Locust trees, surrounded by well-watered alfalfa fields.	One singing out in alfalfa field across main road from ranch near Circle L. On west side of the road. All I could see was a sparrow in distance skylarking and doing the very unique, buzzy, 4-note song. Not sure who found this but found by someone earlier in the day.

It flew a short distance and landed on some metal supports below a picnic table. I quickly shot a few pics as soon as I realized that it was a Cassin's Sparrow.  The pictures are poor but they confirm the identification. The bird was in the grass along the short ball field fence directly south of the flag pole.  Description:  Medium sized sparrow, with a relatively flat head, medium-sized sharply pointed bill, rufous colored post ocular stripe, thin rufous striped crown and nape, black greater coverts with whitish buffy boarders, buffy eyering, long tail, a few thick broad black streaks on rear flanks, thin whitish wingbar, pale supercillium and pale fleshy pinkish legs.  I viewed and photographed the bird for about a minute or two before it flew over the short chain link fence and down onto the grassy ball field.  At this point I lost the bird and was unable to relocate it before dark.  The bird was silent during the observation.----Photos can be seen at:  --https://www.flickr.com/photos/nvbirdr/----Notes and Photos will be submitted to the NBRC.  If accepted, this will be the third state record.

The grounds keepers showed up and got a lawn mower ready near the area where I had the Cassin's Sparrow a few days ago.  I was a little nervous they would make it impossible to find the bird, but the mowing didn't seem to make a difference.  I located the bird in the ball field near the boundary fence.  It moved along the fence line feeding with some White-crowned Sparrows and Chipping Sparrows.  At one point it ventured out into the desert but quickly returned to the grass field.  Eventually I managed to get some excellent photos of the bird as it approached me on a few occasions.  New plumage details observed included the finely barred tail feathers, pale yellowish area between the eye and bill, pale yellow marginal coverts, dingy grayish brownish breast, paler throat, blackish "anchor" marks noted on back feathers and a rusty streaked nape.  The bird seemed a bit uneasy in the open and often moved quickly through bare dirt areas, favoring the deeper grass.  At one point I watched it eat an earth worm by cutting it into small manageable segments.  No vocalizations were noted.  I spent about 40 minutes with the bird today.

While conducting a point count survey, I clearly heard this bird singing. Tracked it down after my survey seems found at least one individual continually singing from a perch or, more frequently, while performing an aerial display. Horrendous photos, but great audio of flight song and perched song. Very recognizable cadence.
