Other vertebrates noted:Uta stansburiana - 3; Crotalus atrox - 1; Ammospermophilus leucurus - 1; Canis latrans - 8; Equus asinus - 3.--Many transient warblers apparently attracted to an 'outbreak' of a small green caterpillar ~1/2" long. Primarily OCWA and NAWA feeding on them.	No description made. We found them on our other nearby transects in similar habitat as long as there were some large cottonwoods around.
